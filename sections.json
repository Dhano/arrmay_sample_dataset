COMMENTS Ground for rejection of testimony of eye witness The conduct of an eye witness in non-disclosing the incident to anybody for a number of days, is highly unnatural one and is sufficient to reject his testimony Ganpat Kondiba Chavan v. State of Maharashtra, 1997 2 Crimes 38 Bom . It is well settled that the conduct of a witness in not disclosing the incident to person s whom he must have met after the incident is indicative of the fact that he had not seen the accident Ganpat Kondiba Chavan v. State of Maharashtra, 1997 2 Crimes 38 Bom . Role of motive in an offence If motive is proved, the case of prosecution becomes more easier to connect accused to the alleged incident P.V. Narayana v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 1997 2 Crimes 307 AP . Normally there is a motive behind every criminal act Barikanoo v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 1997 1 Crimes 500 All . When motive is not sine qua non Where the ocular evidence is very clear and convincing and the role of the accused person in the crime stands clearly established, establishment of motive is not a sine qua non for proving the prosecution case Yunis alias Kariya v. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 2003 SC 539. It is well settled that where the direct evidence regarding the assault is worthy of the credence and can be believed, the question of motive becomes more or less academic. Sometimes the motive is clear and can be proved and sometimes the motive is shrouded in the mystery and it is very difficult to locate the same. If, however, the evidence of eye witnesses is credit-worthy and is believed by the court which has placed implicit reliance on them, the question whether there is any motive or not becomes wholly irrelevant Raja v. State, 1972 2 Crimes 175. Motive is a thing primarily known to the accused himself and it may not the possible for the prosecution in each and every case to find out the real motive behind the crime Barikanoo v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 1997 1 Crimes 500 All . It is well established that where there is an eyewitness account regarding the incident, the motive loses all its importance Barikanoo v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 1997 1 Crimes 500 All ."

The word income is of the widest amplitude and it must be given its natural and grammatical meaning. The definition of income in section 2 24 is inclusive. The purpose of the definition is not to limit the meaning of income but to widen its net and the several clauses therein are not exhaustive of the meaning of income even if a receipt did not fall within the ambit of any of those clauses, it might still be income if it partook the nature of income. The words other games of any sort were of wide amplitude and their meaning was not confined to mere gambling or betting activities. Assuming that the expression winnings had acquired a particular meaning viz. receipts from activities of a gambling or betting nature only, it did not follow that monies received from non- gambling or non- betting activities were not included within the ambit of income. The assessee participated in a car rally and won a prize. The car rally was a contest, if not a race and the assessee entered the contest to win it. What he got was a return for his skill and endurance. It was income construed in its widest sense. Though it was casual in nature, it was nevertheless income."

The purpose of the definition is not to limit the meaning of income but to widen its net and the several clauses therein are not exhaustive of the meaning of income even if a receipt did not fall within the ambit of any of those clauses, it might still be income if it partook the nature of income.
