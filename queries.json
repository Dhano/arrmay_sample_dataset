It, however, instead of retiring the petitioner, decided to defer the consideration of his case for premature retirement for one year after giving direction to the petitioner to improve his performance. After one year, the Review Committee, which now consists of four judges of this Court, once again considered the question and by its report dated 19th July 1993, recommended that the petitioner be prematurely retired. The recommendation was placed before the learned Chief Justice who by the impugned order passed on 27th August, 1993 compulsorily retired the petitioner prematurely with effect from 1st September, 1993 after paying him his pay and allowance for the notice period of three months.

Construed in the light of this juristic principle, the power of \"appointment\" conferred by [SECTION] includes the power to suspend, dismiss, remove or compulsorily retire from service. In short, in regard to the servants and officers of the High Court, [SECTION] makes the power of appointment, dismissal, removal, suspension, reduction in rank, compulsory retirement etc., including the power to prescribe their conditions of service, the sole preserve of the Chief Justice, and no extraneous executive authority can interfere with the exercise of that power by the Chief Justice or his nominee, except to a very limited extent indicated in the provisos. In conferring such exclusive and supreme powers on the Chief Justice, the object which the Founding Fathers had in view, was to ensure independence of the High Court.\""

The case of the petitioner was once again considered by the Review Committee in 1993 when his confidential report indicated that his performance was poor and that he had not shown any improvement.

The accused has no locus in the investigation unless and until it can be made out or pleaded that there was some bias or harassment in the investigation against them.

A-4 and A-5 are not arrested though their application for anticipatory bail was rejected. Petitioner company was threatened by A-4 and A-5 and in spite of receiving three legal notices, respondents have not taken any action. Therefore, according to the learned counsel, police are trying to close the case as it is a civil dispute. On the main question, the learned counsel would submit that the case is not such a great matter requiring take over by CBCID. CID has not given any information to petitioner before taking over the case. Petitioner being complainant is very much interested in the case, from the stage of registration till its culmination in Criminal Court. The take over of case by CID from CCS amounts to wilful interference in the investigation. The case was registered as a private complaint and therefore any investigation ordered by the learned Magistrate under [SECTION] of [ACT] cannot be subject to whims and fancies of executive. The investigation was transferred by DGP to CBCID after A-5 approached Chief Minister's office. The complainant therefore genuinely apprehends that investigation would not be impartial.

If there is any grievance in relation to Police investigation or Police report or a criminal conviction, the aggrieved party has adequate remedies. Merely because on a complaint given by the accused the office of Chief Minister addressed the Commissioner to send a report, the investigation cannot be termed as one-sided or partial. Learned counsel for the petitioner would like this court to draw an inference that when the office of Chief Minister addressed a letter to Commissioner, there is a likelihood of Investigating Officers clamouring to file a report in favour of the accused, cannot be accepted. If any citizen complains to the Head of the Government or the Head of the Police about investigation, it is always open to look into the matter and take appropriate action and in the considered opinion of this Court, that is what precisely has been done. I do not see any reason to draw an inference as suggested by the learned counsel for the petitioner."

[ENTITY], petitioner in [CASE NUMBER], filed an application on October 4, 1990, for allotment of the shop, setting out his qualifications and also informing that he had been registered at the Regional Employment Exchange for four years and also indicated the premises where he proposed to set up the fair price shop. Original guide lines were laid down under the letter of the under Secretary dated 13th May, 1987, but the preference mentioned therein was modified and the class of educated unemployed was given first preference. The respondent No. 3 did not belong to the categories to which preference was to be given and belonged to the last residual category. She had been allotted a bakery licence as a widow of a freedom fighter. According to the petitioner, she had also three bar licences-one in her own name, other in the name of her deceased husband and the third, in the name of her son. She is also receiving the pension as the widow of a deceased freedom fighter and Ex-MLA. The petitioner's contention was that it was not legally open to the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to depart from the criteria and the order of preference prescribed and to allot the fair price shop in an arbitrary manner to the respondent No. 3."

Shri [ENTITY], however, urged that the guide lines cannot be equated with standards or norms as understood in [ENTITY]'s case, and relying on [PRECEDENT], , urged that the guide-lines issued by the State Government had no statutory force and they were merely in the nature of executive instructions for the guidance of the Collectors. There, on the basis of the guidline, the Collectors were asked to forward proposals for formation of Revenue Mandals and for location of Mandal Head-quarters. The proposals so forwarded by the Collectors were processed in the Secretariate in the light of the suggestions and objections received in response to the preliminary notification issued by the Government and then placed before a Cabinet Sub Committee.

            "Precedent",
            "In [ENTITY]'s case, the Supreme Court pointed out that the guide-lines there were merely in the nature of instructions issued by the State Government to the Collectors regulating the manner in which they should formulate their proposals for formation of a Revenue Mandal or for location of its Headquarters keeping in view the broad guidelines laid down in Appendix I to the White Paper, and were mere departmental instructions meant for the Collectors, which is not the case here. The observation in [PRECEDENT] are of no assistance to the respondents, because what was challenged there was not the violation of any statutory rule but only certain guidelines which were more or less broad policy considerations from which minor deviations were permissible if the circumstances justify the same. Obviously, these observations would not show that a total departure from the guidelines would be permissible. Nor are the observations in [PRECEDENT], , of any assistance to the respondents. In para 64, it was observed that the power of discretion of the Government in the matter of grant of larges including award of jobs, contracts quotas, licences etc., must be confirmed and structure by rational, relevant and non discriminatory standard or norm and if the Government departed from such standard or norm in any particular case or cases, the action of the Government would be liable to be struck down, unless it could be shown by the Government that the departure was not arbitrary but was based on some valid principle which in itself was not irrational, irrelevant, unreasonable or discriminatory. There, the Court found that there had been no deviations from the guidelines. In [PRECEDENT], , the questions arose about the interpretation of the Government guidelines, and the Court held that if a party had been consistently and bona fide interpreting the standard prescribed by it in a particular manner, the Court should not interfere though it may be inclined to read or construe the conditions differently. This is not to say that the Government is not bound by the guidelines prescribed by it. If the respondents wanted to depart from the order of preference, at least, there should have been some indication why they were departing from the preference, and this is not forthcoming either in the order of allotment or the returns filed by the respondents."

            "6. Petitioner-[ENTITY] did not mention in his petition that he was working as an apprentice. This was a stand taken in the return filed on behalf of the respondent No. 3. Petitioner [ENTITY] stated in his rejoinder that he was registered as an apprentice in the trade of Mechanic Tractor in the Directorate of Agriculture, and it did not amount to employment. We should have expected a reference to this position in the petition, but merely because that disclosure was not made in the petition, we do not think that the petitioner can be said to have come it unclean hands. As pointed out in the [PRECEDENT], , the heart of the matter in the apprenticeship is the dominant object and intent to impart on the part of the employer and to accept on the part of the other person learning under certain agreed terms. That certain payment is made during the apprenticeships, by whatever name called, and that the apprentice has to be under certain rules of the discipline do not convert the apprentice to a regular employees under the employer. Such a person remains a learner and is not an employee. The submission of Shri [ENTITY] was that these observations came to be made in the context of the provisions of the [ACT], and are not of general application. But, this is not correct, because while dealing with the nature of relationship of master and servant, the Supreme Court took into consideration the position under the ordinary law. We have considered the terms of the apprenticeship agreement filed by the petitioner-[ENTITY] and it is clear to us that petitioner [ENTITY] could not be said to be an employee under that agreement. Shri [ENTITY], however, urged that the petitioners was to get more than Rs. 300/- as a stipend and could not, therefore, be said to be an indigent person who was not in receipt of any remuneration and, therefore, entitled to a preferential treatment under the guidelines. It is not possible to accept this contention, because even the order of preference does not enumarate only the categories of indigent person. There are several categories mentioned, but there is no reference to any restrictions on the basis of income. It is also clear to us that the respondent No. 3 could not have been ignore because she had other licences, though the position that she had more than one licence has been denied. That was not a factor which was laid down in the guide lines. We are not inclined to decline a relief to the petitioner only because he had not referred to his apprenticeship agreement."

This position was denied by the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 and we see from the copy of the report of the Mamlatdar also that petitioner-[ENTITY] had not furnished the requisite information. This was in relation to this eligibility, and we do not think that if the prima facie proof regarding his answering the essential condition were not furnished, he would be entitled to agitate that he had wrongly been left out of consideration.

There is no indication under what authority this press-note came to be issued, and if some additional requirement is mentioned in the press-note, apart from the guide-lines, that requirement cannot be regarded to have been essential. No plan was raised in the returns filed by the respondents that the business experience, or dealing in other essential commodities, was necessary, and in the absence of such a ground, the plea cannot be entertained, in view of the observations in [PRECEDENT], , as oral submissions raising new points for the first time tend to grave injury to a contesting party by depriving it of the opportunity, to which the principles of natural justice hold it entitled, of adequately preparing its response."

The said order was passed for the year ending 30.9.1974 for the assessment year 1975-76. The petitioner furnished a return showing his income during the relevant assessment year on 30.6.75. He furnished a revised Income-tax return. The petitioner, before the assessing authority claimed depreciation. An order of assessment was made on 2.6.1978 assessing the total income at Rs. 81,38,810/- and holding the petitioner liable to pay a sum of Rs. 37,13,047/- on account of income tax and interest. A demand notice for the said sum was accordingly served on the petitioner. The petitioner applied for waiver of interest in terms of [SECTION] of the Act. The said claim of the petitioner was rejected by an order dated 24.8.1978 where after the petitioner filed a revision petition in terms of [SECTION] of the Act which as noticed hereinabove, was allowed in part. In its impugned order, the second respondent rejected partly the prayer for waiver of interest inasmuch as, interest for a period of 15 months i.e. for the period 1.4.1975 to 30.6.76 was not waive and interest for the period for 1.7.76 to 21.6.78 was waived."

The rule does not even faintly indicate that where these conditions are satisfied, interest for the first year must be levied. The rule in fact provides for waiver or reduction of interest without any such limitations. No doubt, [SECTION] gives the date from which interest can be charged but the said sub section cannot be read in isolation. Sub-section (4) cannot be ignored and all parts of [SECTION] will have to be read harmoniously as a whole. From the general scheme of [SECTION], it would be clear that under [SECTION] the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner has the widest power in the matter of waiver of interest with no statutory limitations or conditions prescribed for its exercise. All the five sub-rule of [SECTION] deal with different situations and they are independent of each other. Therefore, it cannot be said that [SECTION] will not operate in cases governed by [SECTION]. [SECTION] nowhere limits the discretion, once the conditions are satisfied. To hold otherwise would amount to rewriting the rule.\""

That letter of denial is assailed in another writ petition being [CASE NUMBER] by the borrower. If the restructuring of loan is approved, then there shall be no outstanding dues to be realized. borrower is paying a sum of Rs. 8.00 lakhs per month towards repayment of the loan amount. Originally, sanction letter provided for repudiation of the loan in 84 equal installments which would come to an end only in 2018. However, the respondent bank has chosen to invoke the provisions of [ACT] to put the properties of the guarantors on auction in a devious way perhaps acting on the behest of some interested bidders. It has been further submitted that the Bank had permitted restructuring of loan on 26.09.2013 whereunder, payments were to commence from June 2015.

After declaration of the Loan A/c as Non Performing Assets (NPA), steps for realization of the outstanding loan through the mode of [ACT] has been invoked.

Learned counsel for the respondent Bank has also relied upon a judgment of the Apex Court rendered in the case of [PRECEDENT].

It has brought on record the Notification of the Land Reforms and Revenue Department, Government of Jharkhand dated 17.08.2004 whereunder, the district of Deoghar and several other districts have been covered under the provisions of [SECTION] of the [ACT].

During his examination in chief also, the address stated by him is 'Near DDA Flats VPO Bakarwala Nangloi Delhi.' However during his cross examination it was stated by the accused that the address stated by him during his examination in chief was correct except that 'near DDA flats' was wrongly mentioned. It was further stated by him that his residence is near R.K. Memorial School and DDA flats are around half a kilometer from his residence. In my opinion, the subsequent statement of the accused regarding his address is of no consequence in light of his deposition on this aspect during the examination in chief. It is merely an afterthought. Even the improvement sought to be made by him in his testimony is insignificant as it hardly indicates any substantial change in the address. It is settled law that if the demand notice is properly and correctly addressed, there is presumption of service thereof. For this proposition, reliance is placed upon the pronouncements of the Supreme Court in [PRECEDENT] and [PRECEDENT]. It is then for the accused to prove that he did not receive the demand notice. As the accused in the present case has not been able to dispel this presumption, service of demand notice stands proved."

While at the time of framing of notice and in his statement under [SECTION] [ACT], it is stated by the accused that he had given the cheque in question to the complainant for purchase of a car from him, the story put forth by him while cross examining the complainant is that the accused gave the impugned cheque to the complainant for the purpose of investment in City Limousines and City Real Com. In the present case, the accused has brought forth documentary evidence in support of his case. The fulcrum of the version propounded by the accused is Ex. DW1/X (Mark A). The complainant admitted his signatures thereon. However a specific suggestion was put to the accused that the same was given blank to the accused which was denied by him. It is also the case of the complainant that he invested in City Limouzine, City Real Com and City Cooperative Credit Society through the accused. Thus an explanation has been furnished by the complainant as to how a blank document signed by him came into the possession of the accused. Perusal of this document reveals that the same is typed and signatures of the complainant appear right at the bottom and there is a noticeable gap between the signature and the body of the document. This lends credence to the version of the complainant that the document was taken in blank signed form from him. Further, the stamp at the back of the document bears the date 15.12.2000 and the same is also admitted by the accused during his cross examination whereas the document is purportedly in respect of a transaction which has taken place in the year 2009. It therefore gives rise to a very justifiable question as to why a stamp paper bought in 2000 was written in 2009 for which there is no explanation forthcoming. This question in turn gives rise to a serious doubt regarding the credibility of the document itself. Interestingly, this document also bears the signature of a third person but it is stated by the accused that he does not know as to whose signature it is."

To buttress his claim that the complainant misrepresented to him that he was an investment agent of the aforesaid companies, the accused has placed on record [ENTITY] and Mark C which stand proved as the complainant has admitted his signatures thereon and not denied their contents. It is therefore important to examine the nature of these documents. [ENTITY] is an agreement between City Real Com and the complainant executed on 5.1.2009 whereby City Real Com, the owner of a particular property has allotted the partial ownership thereof to the complainant to safeguard the interest of the complainant in the redeemable preference shares in the sum of Rs. 1, 07, 000 allotted to him by City Real Com. Mark C is an agreement between City Limouzines (India) Ltd. and the complainant whereby the complainant agrees to take vehicles on lease/hire or margin amounts towards purchase of motor vehicles from City Limouzines. From the contents of these documents it cannot be deduced that the complainant is an investment agent of City Limouzines Ltd. or City Real Com Ltd. On the other hand, it is the case of the accused that the complainant used these documents to misrepresent to him that he was an investment agent of City Limouzines Ltd. and City Real Com Ltd. and thereby induce him to part with the cheques."

The Ld. counsel for the accused has contended that the complainant has not disclosed the source of funds out of which he gave the alleged friendly loans to the accused and therefore this fact by itself dispels the presumption lying in his favour. In support of this proposition, the accused has relied upon three judgments. However, upon perusal of these judgments, I am of the view that they are not applicable to the facts of the present case. In [PRECEDENT], the complainant had specifically mentioned the sources of money out of which the loan amount was given but he had been unable to prove those sources. In [PRECEDENT], the complainant had advanced a loan of 31 lakhs i.e. a huge amount but not specified the date on which the loan was given. Further albeit the complainant had stated that the loan was given on interest, the rate of interest had not been disclosed. In that case, the complainant was a money lender and the loan amount had been advanced without any written agreement which belied the prudence one would associate with a moneylender. In these circumstances, the court came to the conclusion that the conduct of the complainant was unlikely. In [PRECEDENT] again there were various infirmities in the evidence of the complainant. The complainant in that case was not aware as to when and where the loan was given. Further there was a difference in the handwriting in which the particulars had been filled in the impugned cheque. In light of these infirmities, the trial court acquitted the accused which was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court. In my opinion, it was incumbent upon the accused to impeach the solvency of the complainant. But no suggestions to that effect were put to the complainant. On the other hand, the complainant has stated that he is in the business of real estate and this fact remains uncontroverted by the accused. If that be the case, it would not be implausible for the complainant to advance the loan in question."

            "2. On 23.7.86 the opposite party No. 1-complainant had filed a petition of complaint before the learned Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Calcutta, against the four petitioners-accused and another under [SECTION], [SECTION] and [SECTION], [ACT], on the allegations made therein. It had been contended, inter alia, therein that he (complainant) is the acting Managing Mutwali of Imambara and Trust Estate at 10, Portugese Church Street, Calcutta-700 001, which is an exclusive Wakf property, now under the direct control of this Hon'ble Court and a Special Officer has also been appointed to look after the affairs of the said Trust. On 21.7.86, when the complainant was away from the aforesaid premises the \"accused\" had come to the spot at 11.30 A.M. with apparatus and had broken upen the shutters which were fixed in front of two shops within the Imambara premises, The \"accused \" had dismantled the said shutters and had taken away the same in presence of the local people without talking to any authority of the Estate. The \"accused\" by \"misusing their own respective power\" had exercised the same in a detrimental way, and is liable to be punished in accordance with law. The learned Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, upon perusal of the complaint and upon examination of the complainant and two other witnesses and the materials on record was of opinion that there was sufficient ground for proceedings against the accused persons under [SECTION], [ACT] only, and had accordingly directed issue of summons against them all by his order dated 23.7.86. A petition appears to have been subsequently filed on behalf of the accused on 2.2.88 praying for their discharge on the grounds made out therein, which was also rejected by the learned Magistrate, to whom the case was assigned by order dated 21.6.88. The four petitioners-accused have thereupon moved this Court in Revision under [SECTION] of the Code for quashing the relevant proceedings mainly on the ground that the principal ingredient of an offence punishable under [SECTION], [ACT] have not been made out in the absence of any whisper about dishonest intention on the part of the petitioners-accused as also intention to cause wrongful gain to themselves. It had further been contended by them that the criminal prosecution has been instituted by the complainant maliciously for wreaking vengeance on the accused and to stall the action taken by them for stopping unauthorised construction at premises No. 10, Portugese Church Street, and unauthorised and illegal construction at Karbala Mohammad Lane on the back portion of the aforesaid premises, as stated at length in the relevant application. It is further contended by the petitioners-accused that the opposite party No. 1-complainant, in gross abuse of the process of criminal court has been continuing encroachment on Karbala Mohammad Lane with impunity in gross violation of law by putting the petitioners, who are public servants, acting according to law, on the dock for an alleged offence punishable under [SECTION], [ACT]"

The question of wrongful gain to one and wrongful loss to another is also required to be taken into consideration while dealing with such an alleged offence. Unhappily for the complainant, there is not the merest and faintest whisper within the four corners of the petition of complaint that the accused-petitioners had taken away the shutters in question with any \"dishonest intention.\" Per contra, the complainant had himself sadly sought to contend in paragraph 7 of the petition of complaint that the articles in question had been allegedly taken away by the \"accused\" by \"misusing their own respective power.\" The complainant and the two witnesses examined by him under [SECTION] of the Code, P.W. 2 [ENTITY] and P.W. 3 [ENTITY] did neither whisper about any such \"dishonest intention\" on the part of the accused concerned during their evidence. The alleged misuse of power, occurring in paragraph 7 of the petition of complaint, would clearly exclude the element of \"dishonest intention\" on the part of the accused concerned. There being no allegation of \"dishonest intention\" on the part of the petitioners-accused in the petition of complaint or in the statements of the complainant and his aforesaid two witnesses, while examined under [SECTION] of the Code, the allegations made by the complainant do not prima facie seem to make out an offence punishable under [SECTION], [ACT], against any of the petitioners-accused."

The complaint, as it is, does not indicate which accused had broken open the shutters and had taken away the same, as alleged. The petitioner No. 1-accused, [ENTITY], appears to be the Conservancy Officer, the petitioner No. 2-accused, [ENTITY], appears to be the District Conservancy Officer, petitioner No. 3-accused, [ENTITY], appears to be the Deputy City Architect, and the petitioner No. 4-accused, [ENTITY] appears to be a member of the Staff of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

That being so, no wrongful personal gain could conceivably have been intended by any of the petitioners-accused by removal of the -same, as alleged. Upon the discussions above, the materials placed before the learned Magistrate do not prima facie seem to make out an offence punishable under [SECTION], [ACT], against the petitioners-accused. As indicated above, the allegations made in the complaint that the petitioners-accused had themselves broken open the shutters in question and bad taken away the same seem to be so absurd and inherently improbable for the reasons discussed above on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against them. And in view of the illustrations given in the decision of the Supreme Court in the [PRECEDENT], the High Court would be justified in exercising its inherent power under [SECTION] of the Code to quash proceedings in such a case to prevent abuse of the process of court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice."

Apart from the materials presented before the learned Magistrate, the materials on record as also the relevant official papers shown during the hearing, xerox copies of which had been filed with copies to the other side, which could very well be translated into relevant piece of evidence and may thus be taken into consideration by this Court while considering the question of quashing the instant proceedings under [SECTION] of the Code would clearly seem to indicate that the Building Development of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had detected an unauthorised construction at the premises No. 10, Portugese Church Street, Calcutta, on 16.7.86, and a notice under [SECTION] of the [ACT] (hereinafter shortened into Act) had been sevred on that date with directions to stop all constructions, including additions and alterations at the said premises. The Annexure 'A' to the instant application would seem to bear out the said contention. The Annexure 'B' would further indicate that a letter dated 17.7.86 was addressed by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to the Officer-in-Charge, Barabazar Police Station, requesting for follow up action to the aforesaid notice for prevention of unauthorised construction at the said premises. The official papers shown would further indicate that Sri [ENTITY], a Local Councillor, had informed the petitioner No. 2 over phone and toy letter dated 18.7.86 that complaints had been received from the inhabitants of the locality that an unauthorised and illegal construction was going on at Karbala Mohammad Lane, Calcutta-7, on the back portion of premises No. 10, Portugese Church Street, Calcutta. On inspection made at the site on 19.7,86, it was found by the Officers of the Corporation that the opposite party No. 1-complainant was not only making unauthorised construction but was also causing encroachment on the Corporation road by fixing up four channels of Rolling Shutters on the kerb channel of the Karbala Mohammad Lane, being the road on the backside of premises No. 10, Portugese Church Street, in violation of the provisions of the aforesaid Act. The Corporation authorities had thereupon directed the said obstruction to be removed. And by virtue of the powers conferred under [SECTION] of the aforesaid Act, the Officers of the Corporation, in bona fide exercise of such powers, had removed the said illegal encroachment on Karbala Mohammad Lane, and had removed the said four channels of Rolling Shutters, which had been illegaly fixed causing encroachment on the said road, and the same was kept in the custody of the Corporation at their Brabourne Road Fly Over Office. It is submitted on behalf of the petitioners-accused that the aforesaid articles had been removed in terms of [SECTION] and [SECTION] of the aforesaid Act. The owner/s thereof was/were entitle to take back the same in terms of [SECTION] of the said Act. No wrongful loss could conceivably have been occasioned to him as such. It would be pertinent to note in this context that the complainant had alleged in paragraph 7 of the complaint that the articles in question had been removed' by the accused \"by misusing their respective power\". But in view of the materials on record and the official papers shown to me the petitioners' contention that they had removed the same in bona fide exercise of their powers under [SECTION] and [SECTION] of the relevant Act cannot be discarded. The act of the removal of the articles in question by the Officers of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, in the facts and circumstances indicated above could neither be deemed to be an offence in view of the provisions of [SECTION] and [SECTION] of the [ACT]. The petitioners' contention that the prosecution has been instituted by the opposite party No. 1-complainant for wreaking vengeance on the accused and to stall the action already taken by them could neither be lightly overruled in view of the facts and circumstances dis- closed herein. And in view of the illustrations given in the decision of the Supreme Court in the [PRECEDENT], the High Court can exercise its inherent powers under [SECTION] of the Code by quashing a proceeding where a criminal proceeding is attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private or personal grudge. As held by the Supreme Court in the decision in [PRECEDENT]., , the legal position is well settled that when a prosecution at the initial stage is asked to be quashed, the test to be applied by the court is as to whether the uncontroverted allegation as made prima facie establish the offence. It is also for the court to take into consideration any special features which appear in a particular case to consider whether it is expedient and in the interest of justice to permit a prosecution to continue. This is so on the basis that the court cannot be utilised for any oblique purpose and where in the opinion of the court chances of an ultimate conviction are bleak and, therefore, no useful purpose is likely to be served by allowing a criminal prosecution to continue, the court may while taking into consideration the special facts of a case also quash the proceedings even though it may be at a preliminary stage. In view of the facts and circumstances and the special features indicated above the relevant proceedings is clearly liable to be quashed."

The petitioners have contended that the four channels of Rolling Shutters removed by them had been seized by the police and returned back to the opposite party No. 1-complainant on his prayer by the orders of the learned Magistrate and he (opposite party No. 1) had again fixed the same causing encrochment on the Corporation Road at Karbala Mohammad Lane on the back portion of premises No. 10, Portugese Church Street. He is continuing with such encroachment with impunity in violation of law in gross abuse of the process of the criminal court. Should it really be so, the appropriate authority of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation should be at liberty to take action thereagainst according to law. It would be pertinent to recall in this context the observation of the Supreme Court of India in the case of [PRECEDENT], , that footpaths or pavements are public properties which are intended to serve the convenience of the general public. If a person puts any public property to use for which it is not intended and is not authorised so to use it, he becomes a trespasser. Public streets, of which pavement forms a part, are primarily dedicated for the purpose of passage, and even the pedestrian have the limited right of using pavement for the purpose of passing and repassing. The Corporation is thus under an obligation to remove obstructions upon public streets. On the analogy of the aforesaid decision, the obligatory duty of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation under [SECTION] and [SECTION] of the [ACT] would extend to removal of the alleged obstruction/encroachment allegedly caused by the opposite party No. 1-complainant on the Corporation Road/Footpath at Karbala Mohammad Lane on the back portion of premises No. 10, Portugese Church Street, Calcutta."

On a detailed examination of the relevant provisions of the Act, the Rules and the Standing Orders, the High Court held that the place of location of the Tribunal's Bench which heard and determined the appeal did not provide a basis for the determination of the jurisdiction of the High Court to which a case has to be stated by way of reference. Since the appeal to the Tribunal arose out of the assessment order of the Income-tax Officer, at Meerut in the State of Uttar Pradesh, it was held that the reference has to be made to the Allahabad High Court.

This basis, however, has not been adopted in providing the basis for the determination of the jurisdiction of a Bench of the Appellate Tribunal. Under the Explanation to [CASE NUMBER], as well as to [CASE NUMBER], the aforesaid basis under [SECTION] was expressly given a go by, and the basis of the location of the office of the Assessing Office has been adopted.

In other words, the Bench hears appeals and applications in the cases coming from the States over which it has been given jurisdiction.

The first agreement was dated 30-12-1999 and was styled as an Agreement of Sale. This agreement was entered into between M/s. William's Beach Retreat Private Ltd., of which the complainant is the Managing Director on one hand, and the accused and his wife on the other hand. By the said agreement, the accused and his wife agreed to purchase a hotel complex known as William Resorts for a sum of Rs. 3,30,00,000/-, out of which Rs. 25,00,000/- were paid and the balance of Rs. 57,67,873/- was payable and was to be paid as indicated in Para 4 of the agreement by the end of January, 2001. Another agreement dated 1-10-2001, came to be executed between the complainant and the Accused and this agreement was styled as Agreement of Settlement of Accounts. As per this agreement, seven cheques were issued with different dates mentioned on the said cheques to the complainant and there is no dispute that the first five cheques were honoured by the Accused. The dispute arose as regards the sixth cheque bearing No. 156749 dated 15-2-2002 and the seventh cheque bearing No. 082601 dated 15-3-2002.

In this letter, on behalf of the accused, reference was made to the statutory notice sent by the complainant to the Accused. In this letter, it was stated that the complainant had requested the accused to make the payments and deduct the amount from the amount payable to the complainant under the settlement and as per the complainant's request, the accused had cleared the said payments and discharged the complainant's liability. It was also stated that by virtue of the said letter dated 15-4-2002, the complainant had authorized the accused to make the deduction in the sum of Rs. 1,21,351/-. It was also stated that the gross amount payable to the complainant was Rs. 3,78,649/-. However, it is to be noted that the accused did not send the said amount to the complainant but stated that the accused was prepared to make the said payment subject to certain conditions including a condition that the complainant returns the dishonoured cheques and the complainant gives no objection letter to the accused for obtaining extension of OTS from EDC etc. The said letter was replied to by the complainant by letter dated 30-4-2002. On behalf of the complainant, it was made clear to the accused that as per settlement by virtue of agreement dated 1-10-2001, there was no scope for the accused to seek deductions on the claims of payment either by way of sales tax or luxury taxes or money due to the employees which were all dues payable by the said Company M/s. William Beach Retreat Private Limited. On behalf of the complainant it was also stated that the complainant had not made any request to the accused and, therefore, there was no question to request the accused to make any payment or deduct any payment made against the dues to the accused. The complainant explained in Paras 12(a) to (g) under what circumstances the said letter dated 15-4-2002 came to be issued by the complainant and the complainant also withdrew the said letter dated 15-4-2002 and further called upon the accused to pay the amount within two days from the date of the receipt of the reply by the accused. The complainant also threatened to terminate the agreement in case his demand was not met in relation to the Management of the said M/s. William Beach Retreat Private Limited.

The accused also requested the complainant to send to the accused duly signed receipt for the said sum of Rs. 5,00,000/- and also a letter acknowledging that all amounts payable by the accused to the complainant under the said two agreements were fully paid. The accused also requested the complainant to return the two dishonoured cheques. It may be noted that this letter dated 4-6-2002, was not received by the complainant within two days as stipulated and was in fact received on 7-5-2002 and, therefore, the complainant by letter dated 11-5-2002, returned the said demand draft further alleging that the complainant had suffered losses on various counts in the sum of Rs. 15,00,000/-."

Admittedly, the statutory notice was received by the accused on 2-4-2002 and the accused was required to comply with the same on or about 17-4-2002, which admittedly, the accused did not comply either by sending the sum of Rs. 2,50,000/- as claimed by the complainant or for that matter, as contended by the accused by sending Rs. 3,78,649/-. The letter dated 15-4-2002 was withdrawn by the complainant by his letter dated 30-4-2002 and i.e. even before the accused could have acted on the said letter. The said letter dated 15-4-2002 had merely authorized the accused to make the payments as stipulated therein and deduct the amount due towards the hotel account. It was certainly not the case of the accused that at any time, he had made the said payments and acted on the said letter. The said letter did not at all refer to the subject cheque/s issued earlier or the agreements executed earlier and, therefore, it could not have been taken by any stretch of imagination that it was issued by way of modification or alteration of the earlier agreement/s. The suggestions put to the complainant that the complainant had authorised the Accused to deduct the sum of Rs. 1,21,351/- from the balance amount of Rs. 5 lacs due on subject cheque/s was not translated by the accused into evidence by stepping into the witness box. Since the accused had not proved that he acted upon the said letter and paid the amount as per the said letter and the same was withdrawn even before it was acted upon, the same could not be taken by way of alteration or modification of the agreement/s earlier entered into between both the parties. The view taken by the learned CJM, will also be incorrect in view of the said letter dated 30-4-2002."

The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate entirely lost sight of the fact that the complainant had explained under what circumstances the said letter dated 15-4-2002 came to be issued by him when he was called to the respondents' office. All that the accused had stated as regards the same in his statement under [SECTION] of the Code, was that he had pointed out to the complainant that the amount was not due since the deductions were to be made as per his request. Firstly, it must be noticed that the said letter does not contemplate of making any deductions from the amount as regards to the said cheques and all it does is that it authorizes the accused to make the payments mentioned therein and deduct the amount due by the accused from his hotel account. If, as per the accused the said letter dated 15-4-2002 was interpreted by the accused as authorizing him to deduct the said sum of Rs. 1,21,351/- from the amount of the two cheques of Rs. 5,00,000/-, it was for the accused to have given evidence in that regard. The learned CJM entirely lost sight of the fact that the accused had not paid the amount of the first cheque i.e. Rs. 2,50,000/- or balance amount of the second cheque after deducting Rs. 1,21,351/- before the expiry of the period of the second notice on 17-4-2002. The learned CJM also ignored the presumptions which were availabe to the complainant. In this context, reference could be made to the case of [PRECEDENT]. , wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has stated that \"the High Court appears to have proceeded on the basis that the denials/averments in his reply dated 21-5-1993, were sufficient to shift the burden of proof on the complainant to prove that the cheque was issued for a debt or liability and that was entirely erroneous approach\". The Court held that the accused was required to prove in the trial by leading cogent evidence that there was no debt or liability and the accused having not led any evidence, could not have been said to have discharged the burden cast on him and the accused having not discharged the burden of proof that the cheque was not issued for a debt or liability, the conviction as awarded by the Magistrate was correct. In the case at hand, the accused had given his explanation as to under what circumstances the said letter dated 15-4-2002 came to be issued, apart from the fact that the said letter was withdrawn by the complainant subsequently by letter dated 30-4-2002. There was nothing improbable in the explanation furnished by the complainant as regards to the circumstances in which the said letter came to be issued and in the absence of any evidence given to the contrary by the accused. The notice sent by the complainant had remained without being complied till 17-4-2002 and prior to that date, the accused did not think fit to make part payment if according to the accused, the accused was entitled to deduct any amount from the cheque/s, which the accused had given pursuant to the said second agreement. The learned CJM in the absence of any evidence having been given by the accused, ought to have accepted the evidence of the complainant including the explanation given by the complainant as regards the said letter dated 15-4-2002, which in the absence of any evidence led by the accused, did not at all appear to be improbable."

On the other hand, Shri [ENTITY], the learned Counsel on behalf of the complainant has submitted that the expression \"before the complaint is filed\" appearing in the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of [PRECEDENT] (supra), cannot be considered to be the ratio of the said judgment and the said expression is nothing but a casual observation of the Apex Court unrelated to the points decided in the said case.

If payment is made within the said period of notice, then no offence gets committed but in case of failure, the offence is completed. Even if the payment is made on the 16 day the same is not sufficient to come out of the rigours of [SECTION] of the Act. In Criminal law, commission of offence is one thing and prosecution for it is quite another. Commission of an offence of dishonour of cheque is governed by [SECTION] of the Act. Prosecution is governed by [SECTION] of the Act and one has nothing to do with the other. The offence under [SECTION] of the Act is completed in all respects upon the failure by the accused to comply with the notice of demand. In the case of [PRECEDENT], (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court stated that so far as the criminal complaint is concerned, once the offence is committed, any payment made subsequent thereof, will not absolve the accused of the liability of the criminal offence, though in the matter of awarding of sentence, it may have some effect on the Court trying the offence. The Supreme Court also stated that the object of issuing notice indicating the factum of dishonour of cheques, is to give an opportunity to the drawer to make payment within 15 days, so that it will not be necessary for the payee to proceed against in any criminal action, even though the Bank dishonoured the cheques. The Supreme Court also observed that having regards to the object of issuance of a notice, the notices issued cannot be construed in a narrow technical way without examining the substance of the matter. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of [PRECEDENT] (supra), was considering, inter alia, whether the deposit of the entire amount covered by three cheques while the matter was pending in Court, would make any difference and answered the said question by stating that so far the criminal complaint is concerned, once the offence is committed, any payment made subsequent thereto, will not absolve the accused of the liability of criminal offence, though in the matter of awarding of sentence, it may have some affect on the Court trying the offence by the same analogy. If payment is made after the offence is committed but before a criminal complaint is filed, it can have the same effect namely, it cannot absolve the accused of criminal liability but it can at the most be taken into consideration while awarding the sentence. The Apex Court in the case of [PRECEDENT]. (supra), was dealing with the question as to whether the notice issued under [SECTION] of the Act, was valid or not, and in that context, the Supreme Court observed in Paras 9 and 10 as follows:"

        [
            "Precedent",
            "9. This Court had occasion to deal with [SECTION] of the Act in [PRECEDENT] , and held that the object of the notice is to give a chance to the drawer of the cheque to rectify his omission. Though in the notice demand for compensation, interest, cost, etc. is also made, the drawer will be absolved from his liability under [SECTION] if he makes the payment of the amount covered by the cheque of which he was aware within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice or before the complaint is filed."

        [
            "Precedent",
            "10. In [SECTION] the legislature clearly stated that for the dishonoured cheque the drawer shall be liable for conviction if the demand is not met within 15 days of the receipt of notice but this is without prejudice to any other provision of the Act. If the cheque amount is paid within the above period or before the complaint is filed the legal liability under [SECTION] will cease and for recovery of other demands as compensation, costs, interest, etc., a civil proceeding will lie. Therefore, it in a notice any other sum is indicated in addition to the 'said amount' the notice cannot be faulted, as stated above."

[ENTITY] that the expression \"before the complaint is filed\", cannot be considered to be a casual observation since it is found twice in Paras 9 and 10 of the judgment in the case of [PRECEDENT]. (supra) and also followed in [PRECEDENT] (supra). However, both the learned Counsel concede that the said expression \"before the complaint is filed\", does not appear in the case of [PRECEDENT]. . Shri [ENTITY] further submits that the said expression \"before the complaint is filed\", has causally appeared in the case of [PRECEDENT] (supra), in paras 8 and 9 of the learned judgment."
        ],
        [
            "Precedent",
            "18. The Apex Court in [PRECEDENT] , has held that since [SECTION] of the [ACT] was neither raised nor argued, a discussion by the Court after \"pondering over the issue in depth\" would not be a precedent binding on the Courts. In the case of [PRECEDENT], the Supreme Court has stated that it is well settled that a precedent is an authority only for what it actually decides and not for what may remotely or even logically follows from it. The Supreme Court has further held that a decision on a question which has not been argued, cannot be treated as a precedent. In the case of [PRECEDENT]. , the Supreme Court has observed that the scope and authority of a precedent should never be expanded unnecessarily beyond the needs of a given situation. The only thing binding as an authority upon a subsequent Judge, is the principle upon which the case was decided. Statements which are not part of the ratio decidendi are distinguished as obiter dicta and are not authoritative. The task of finding the principle is fraught with difficulty as without an investigation into the facts, it cannot be assumed whether a similar direction must or ought to be made as a measure of social justice. Precedents sub silentio and without argument are of no moment. Mere causal expressions carry no weight at all, nor every passing expression of a Judge, however eminent, can be treated as an ex cathedra statement having the weight of authority. In [PRECEDENT] , the Supreme Court has stated that a decision is a precedent on its own facts. Each case presents its own features. It is not everything said by a Judge while giving judgment that construes a precedent. The only thing in a Judge's decision binding a party is the principle upon which the case is decided and for this reason it is important to analyze a decision and isolate from it the ratio decidendi. According to the well-settled theory of precedents, every decision contains three basic postulates; (i) findings of material facts, direct and inferential. An inferential finding of facts is the inference which the Judge draws from the direct, or perceptible facts; (ii) statements of the principles of law applicable to the legal problems disclosed by the facts; and (iii) judgment based on the combined effect of the above. A decision is an authority for what it actually decides. What is of the essence in a decision is its ratio and not every observation found therein, nor what logically flows from the various observations made in the judgment. The enunciation of the reason or principle on which a question before a Court has been decided is alone binding as a precedent. A case is a precedent and binding for what it explicitly decides and no more. The words used by the Judges in their judgments are not to be read as if they are words in an Act of Parliament Referring to the case of [PRECEDENT], the Supreme Court observed that every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved or assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expressions which are found there are not intended to be the exposition of the whole law but governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are found and a case is only an authority for what it actually decides."

            "19. In my humble view, no drawer of a cheque can be absolved of his liability under [SECTION] of the Act if he makes the payment after the notice and before the filing of the complaint and this, I say on the basis that the offence gets completed on the failure of the drawer of the cheque to comply with the notice of the demand as contemplated by [SECTION] of the Act. Any subsequent payment by the drawer of the cheque after failure to comply with the notice either before or after filing the complaint, could be taken only towards the mitigation of the sentence to be imposed upon the drawer of the cheque i.e. the accused in a given case. This conclusion can be safely arrived by taking note of the observations of the Supreme Court in the three cases referred to hereinabove, namely [PRECEDENT]. (supra), Para 10 of [PRECEDENT] (supra) as well as [PRECEDENT], (supra). The said observations of the Supreme Court in the case of [PRECEDENT]. (supra), reproduced in [PRECEDENT] (supra), has therefore, got to be considered as mere casual observations not having the force of ratio or dictum as laid down by the Supreme Court. The contention made on behalf of the accused therefore has got to be rejected. That apart, in the case at hand, the payment tendered on behalf of the accused vide letter dated 4-5-2002 was not accepted by the complainant as it did not comply with the stipulations of the complainant's letter dated 30-4-2002 and therefore it could not be said that the accused had made payment in this case, as otherwise sought to be contended on behalf of the accused. The payment was made only after filing of the complaint and which was accepted by the complainant without prejudice to his rights."

            "Court Reasoning",
            "20. Lastly, Shri [ENTITY] submits that the amount of the subject cheque was not due because the accused was entitled to deduct the sum of Rs. 1,21,351/-, and therefore, the amount of the cheque given exceeded the amount payable to the complainant and therefore the accused was not bound to honour the said cheque. Reliance has been placed by Shri. [ENTITY] on the case of [PRECEDENT], wherein the Madras High Court has held that if the cheque is for an amount higher, then [SECTION] of the Act is not attracted. The above submission of the learned Counsel cannot be accepted. No doubt that the complainant did give the said letter to the accused dated 15-4-2002. The complainant has explained under what circumstances the said letter came to be given to the accused. The complainant subsequently withdrew the said letter by letter dated 30-4-2002. If the accused had rightly understood the said letter as authorizing him to deduct a sum of Rs. 1,21,351/-, nothing prevented the accused from paying Rs. 1,28,649/- by way of compliance to the statutory notice sent to the accused or pay the said sum of Rs. 3,78,649/-, in case the said amount was to be deducted from both the said cheques. The accused neither paid the amount due on the first cheque nor the balance amount of the suit cheque after deducting Rs. 1,21,351/-. The accused also did not send the balance amount as per letter dated 19-4-2002 but instead imposed further conditions against the complainant. The said letter dated 15-4-2002 was in fact withdrawn by the complainant even before it was acted upon by the accused. In my view and in the light of explanation given by the complainant and in the absence of any evidence having been led by the accused, the said letter by no stretch of imagination could have been considered as an authority to the accused to deduct any amount of the cheque/s and pay the balance. The accused having not paid either the whole amount of the cheque or part of the amount which the accused was liable to pay according to him, before the period of the notice, the offence in this case was completed. The ratio of the decision cited is inapplicable to the facts of the case at hand. In that case, part payment of the cheque was received from the accused by the complainant prior to the presentation of the cheque to the Bank, which fact was admitted by the complainant."

            "Conclusion",
            "21. As a result of the above discussion, the appeal deserves to succeed and the judgment dated 31-3-2005 deserves to be set aside. Consequently, the accused is hereby convicted under [SECTION] of the Act. Since the accused has paid the amount of the cheque subsequently before the Court and since in the other case a fine of Rs. 5,000/-was imposed upon the accused, in my view, the adequate sentence to be imposed in this case will be the same i.e. fine of Rs. 5,000/- under [SECTION] of the Act, which the accused is hereby directed to deposit in this Court within a period of three weeks. In case of default, the accused shall undergo S.I. for fifteen days. In case the fine is deposited, the entire amount shall be paid to the complainant."

The plaintiff and the defendant are real brothers, and their father admittedly died in 1928. The property in suit consists of 49 bighas and 6 biswas of land situated in village Nabipur Kalan; this property originally belonged to the erstwhile Kalsia State and was put to auction sometime in September 1931.

It is also agreed that the defendant was born on 16th of July 1916, with the result that he was minor in September 1931 when the property was purchased. The present suit was instituted on 1st of July 1943 claiming declaration and possession with respect to the aforesaid land on the ground that it was the plaintiff who had paid the whole amount from his own pocket and secured the sale certificate as also possession of land a little later; the plaintiff being in service in those days, as an Overseer and the defendant who is his real brother, being a minor and reading in the school, his name was got entered along with that of the plaintiff in the auction papers as well as in the revenue records, merely by way of benami, the real and true owner being the plaintiff only."

In his cross-examination, he has stated that within one hour of registration of the FIR, he has dispatched the original FIR to the Magistrate and that according to his information, it was received at 10.30 a.m. However, a perusal of Ex.P.10 - FIR shows that it was received by the Court at 3.00 p.m. It is true that the unexplained delay in the FIR reaching the Court may give rise to a presumption that it might have been ante-timed. One needs to remember that the day of occurrence happened to be a working day for the Court and it is common knowledge that all the Judicial Officers would go to Bench at 10.30 a.m. As noted hereinbefore, Ex.P.10 contains an endorsement that it was received at 3.00 p.m. These facts would suggest that though the FIR might have been sent by P.W.10 at 10.30 a.m., the Magistrate might have made endorsement of its receipt around lunch time. Ordinarily, in faction cases even a few hours of delay may be fatal, for, it may give rise to false implications. In a case of this nature, such a contingency is completely ruled out. In the instant case, we do not see delay either in registration of Ex.P.10 FIR or its reaching the Court, even if there is any such delay, there is no scope for any false implications."

Being the landlady residing in the same premises in which the offence has taken place, her presence at the scene of occurrence can be taken as a natural. From her evidence it appears that on hearing the cries of the deceased she came out, witnessed the appellant hitting the deceased with a drainage pipe on her head and after she fell down, he has picked up a big stone, threw the same on her head and killed her. No suggestion was put to the witness that she was not present at the scene of offence at the time of occurrence. A suggestion was put to her that she had not seen that it was the appellant who killed the deceased. When it was suggested to P.W.2 that the deceased, her mother, her sister and her brother, who belong to [ENTITY] caste which was BC in Anantapur District, came down to Karimnagar, and that she helped them in obtaining caste certificates as if they are ST community and also to get the house sites allotted, she has denied the said suggestion. She has however admitted that a news report was published in the newspapers that false caste certificates were obtained by the said persons and that the appellant has given a complaint in the Police Station against the mother, sister and brother of the deceased about their obtaining fake caste certificates. It was not suggested to P.W.2 that in the news report it was alleged that the appellant has helped the said three persons in obtaining false caste certificates or getting the house sites allotted to them or that a criminal complaint was given against her also. Except the suggestion that as the appellant has got a news item published as discussed above, no evidence has been adduced to substantiate the said suggestion. In the absence of such evidence, there is no reason for P.W.2 to nurse any grievance against the appellant in order to go to the extent of falsely implicating him in the case."

            "Court Reasoning",
            "15. Even though the evidence of P.W.2 is not supported by any other witness except P.W.1, the law is well settled that the evidence of the sole eyewitness can be relied upon for convicting the accused provided the Court is satisfied that his/her evidence is natural and does not suffer from serious contradictions. In Sunil Kumar v. [ENTITY] (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) , the Supreme Court held that there is no legal impediment in convicting a person on the sole testimony of a single witness. That is the logic of [SECTION] of the [ACT] (in short the [ACT]). But, if there are doubts about the testimony the courts will insist on corroboration. It is for the court to act upon the testimony of witnesses. It is not the number, the quantity, but the quality that is material. The time-honoured principle is that evidence has to be weighed and not counted. On this principle stands the edifice of [SECTION] of the [ACT]. The test is whether the evidence has a ring of truth, is cogent, credible and trustworthy, or otherwise. In Namdeo v. [ENTITY] of Maharashtra the Supreme Court reiterated the said view observing that it is the quality and not the quantity of evidence which is necessary for proving or disproving a fact. The legal system has laid emphasis on value, weight and quality of evidence rather than on quantity, multiplicity or plurality of witnesses. It is, therefore, open to a competent court to fully and completely rely on a solitary witness and record conviction. Conversely, it may acquit the accused in spite of testimony of several witnesses if it is not satisfied about the quality of evidence. In Kunju v. [ENTITY] of Tamil Nadu , this view has been reiterated by the Supreme Court placing reliance on its various earlier judgments. In the case on hand, the tenor of the evidence of P.W.2 sounds natural and we do not see any reason why her testimony can be doubted."

            "16. Apart from the evidence of P.W.2, even the circumstances also rule out the possibility of anybody else killing the deceased. The defence has come out with a fanciful theory that P.W.7, former husband of the deceased, got the deceased killed by sending hired killers from Anantapur. P.W.7 deposed that he is a native of Anantapur and [ENTITY] by caste, that he has been working as Security Guard since 1999, that he himself has visited the deceased for about ten times coming from Ananthapur, that he has visited the deceased even when she was working at Godavarikhani, that he used to speak to P.W.2 whenever he visited his wife and that on receipt of the information about the death of his wife, he directly came from Ananthapur to Government Hospital, Karimnagar. It was suggested to P.W.7 that he along with his brother [ENTITY], elder sister and other relatives visited Gadavarikhani, where the divorce was effected between him and the deceased at that place and that thereafter the deceased married the appellant. This suggestion was denied by the witness. It was suggested to him that as the deceased was earning Rs.15,000/- per month while he was earning Rs.3,000/- per month, he has nursed a grievance against the deceased and therefore he has himself killed her. A contradictory suggestion was followed immediately after the said suggestion that the witness has got the deceased killed by sending hired killers from Anathapur. Interestingly, no such suggestion was put to P.W.2. Even in his [SECTION] [ACT] examination, the appellant did not take this stand. Thus, the said stand taken obviously as an afterthought at the stage of examination of P.W.7 was abandoned later. If P.W.7 has killed the deceased, there was no reason for P.W.2 to depose against the appellant. Apart from Ex.P.1 in which the appellant was named as responsible for the death of the deceased, in Ex.P.8 - inquest report also the witnesses expressed that it is only the appellant who killed the deceased. Nowhere in Ex.P.8 a suspicion was raised against P.W.7. If P.W.7 was really involved in killing of the deceased, there is no reason for the Police to spare him and falsely implicate the appellant. While the discussion undertaken hereinbefore is enough to sustain the conviction against the appellant, there remains the aspect of res gestae."

However, [SECTION] of the [ACT] embodies a principle, usually known as the rule of res gestae in English law, as an exception to hearsay rule. The rationale behind this section is the spontaneity and immediacy of the statement in question which rules out any time for concoction. For a statement to be admissible under [SECTION], it must be contemporaneous with the acts which constitute the offence or at least immediately thereafter. The key expressions in the section are so connected as to form part of the same transaction.

The above mentioned aspects are clearly associated with time, place and circumstances with the offence which thereby form integral part of the same transaction.

Many times she approached the Courts and the Police. It was further alleged that on 09.10.2009 at 8.00 hours while the deceased was going to kirana shop and when she was within the premises of the rented house, the appellant came and uttered as to why she was giving divorce to him and why she was approaching Police, and by taking a drainage pipe available from the ground beat her on her head upon which she collapsed. The fact that the appellant did not carry any weapon shows that he did not nurse premeditated intention of killing the deceased. From the circumstances brought out by the prosecution, it would appear that the appellant has confronted the deceased on the latters attempts to obtain divorce and approaching the Police, not only got intimidated by those acts of the deceased but also deprived himself of self-control and used an earthen drainage pipe available at the scene of offence and beat the deceased. That when the deceased fell down due to the said blow he threw a boulder on her head. These facts show that the appellant has developed the intention to kill the deceased at the spur of the moment after losing his self-control.

It is further contended that [CASE NUMBER] initially filed under [SECTION] of the Code was disposed of on merits vide detailed reasoned order running into 69 pages and when said order was taken into High Court by way of Cri.Misc.Appln. No. 7[SECTION]2 of 2003 by the [ENTITY], at the end of arguments, it was disposed of as withdrawn which amounts to rejection and, therefore, court below ought not to have considered the successive application on all grounds which have been dealt with by the court by way of change in circumstance that too during the pendency of application in the High Court. A show has been made that said application was filed only on change in circumstance but, as such, all possible grounds were taken and it was decided again on merits. It is further contended that even the second successive application filed by the respondent No. 1-[ENTITY] was on the same alleged ground of change in circumstance of non-involvement of the [ENTITY] in the audit report. Drawing my attention towards the record, it is contended that on the day on which successive application was filed, neither the audit work was completed nor the report submitted and in these circumstances, court below ought not to have allowed the successive application on that ground and ought not to have dealt with other grounds which were dealt with once in the first anticipatory bail application. According to him, Special Auditor was appointed not for the purpose of complaint in question. The act of the [ENTITY] is such which would not be apparently visible either by the auditor during the course of audit or the investigating agency because of smart act of the [ENTITY] wherein huge amounts of the bank have been siphoned off. Initially Rs. 8.11 crores were transferred by G.L. No. 156 of Ram Chowk Branch of the complainant bank (sundry account). Out of which, Rs.7.50 crores were transferred in G.L. No. 155 Majura Gate Head Office of the bank on 30-8-2002. Taking me through page nos.29, 30, 37 and 38 of the compilation, it is contended that out of Rs.7.50 crores transferred to two different accounts, Rs.5.62 crores have been transferred in the account of Sitaram Seva Trust by O.D.

Since above referred amounts were directly transferred from the sundry account of the bank, neither the auditor nor the investigating agency can find it out through common eye and, therefore, if it has not been reflected in the accounts, it cannot be said that amounts have not been misappropriated by the present respondent No. 1-[ENTITY] which admittedly was after the closure of functioning of the bank on 30-8-2002 and all moneys have gone to the [ENTITY] on that day. It is further contended that though same arguments advanced in the first anticipatory bail application by the learned Public Prosecutor were advanced by Mr. [ENTITY], learned P.P., who appeared on behalf of the State in the successive application, and also shown evidence to that effect, same were not properly dealt with by the court below. It is also contended that the learned Sessions Judge has also not considered the reasoned order passed by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge in the first application. If the learned Sessions Judge in the successive application wants to reverse the finding given by the Addl. Sessions Judge in the first anticipatory bail application, the reasons given in the first application ought to have been properly dealt with justifying findings."

Public Prosecutor, has drawn my attention towards the principles laid down by the Apex Court in the case of [PRECEDENT] more particularly towards para 19 which reads as under: \"Though an [ENTITY] has a right to make successive applications for grant of bail the court entertaining such subsequent bail application has a duty to consider the reasons and grounds on which the earlier bail applications were rejected. In such cases, the court also has a duty to record what are the fresh grounds which persuade it to take a view different from the one taken in the earlier applications. In the impugned order we do not see any such fresh ground recorded by the High Court while granting bail. It also failed to take into consideration that at least on favour occasions order refusing bail has been affirmed by this Court and subsequently when the High Court did grant bail, this Court by its order dated 26th July, 2000 cancelled the said bail by a reasoned order. From the impugned order, we do not notice any indication of the fact that the High Court took note of the grounds which persuaded this Court to cancel the bail. Such approach of the High Court, in our opinion, is violative of the principle of binding nature of judgments of superior court rendered in a lis between the same parties, and in effect tends to ignore and thereby render ineffective the principles enunciated therein which have a binding character.\""

The serious contention advanced before us by the learned Public Prosecutor is that for further investigation of the case, custodial interrogation of the appellant is very much required. While stating the facts in the beginning, we have noticed that the appellants joined investigation whenever required and as a matter of fact they were interrogated on two occasions for sufficient time. The appellants were named as [ENTITY] for committing offence under [SECTION], [ACT] almost after a period of four and half months from the date of the murder, that too based on the disclosure statement of hardened criminal, the statement of [ENTITY] on whose statement the appellants were involved in the offence was proved to be false and police got him discharged. The submission of the learned Public Prosecutor that earlier investigation made by the police officers and scrutinized by the superiors was faulty and mala fide, is not a ground to put against the appellants at this stage. The appellant No. 1 has also alleged that he is falsely involved in the case because of political rivalry and he was threatened for extracting money; in that regard he had also made complaint to the police seeking protection. Unfortunately, the High Court in the impugned order dated 21-12-2001, cancelling the anticipatory bail granted to the appellants and in the subsequent order dated 22-2-2002, did not consider the contentions raised on behalf of the parties objectively and in proper perspective and did not deal with the reasons recorded and consideration made by the learned Addl.

Sessions Judge, Rewari, had not taken all facts into account and that he granted anticipatory bail to the appellants on 9-4-2001 when the case was at initial stage. We find this statement is factually incorrect looking to the order of the learned Addl. Sessions Judge and the records of the case. The learned Sessions Judge had taken pains to notice the relevant facts and circumstances of the case and that the case was not at the initial stage. The High Court has simply stated that the order of the learned Sessions Judge is based on exercise of judicial discretion in erroneous manner without considering the material on the file. It is strange that the High Court has made such an observation without showing how the judicial discretion exercised by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge was erroneous. A considered order of the learned Addl. Sessions Judge supported by reasons. The High Court has observed \"it is alleged in the present case that the appellant No. 1 wielded great influence and had obtained bail by dubious means\". This observation is not based on any finding. When the learned Addl. Sessions Judges have passed the orders granting anticipatory bail exercising judicial discretion, there is no warrant to say that such an order of bail is obtained by dubious means. The High Court, except referred to two decisions as to the position of law, failed to notice the facts and relevant aspects of the case on hand to apply them.\""

            "23. As discussed above, FIR is a well designed and a well planned typed complaint submitted by the then Chairman showing 60 persons as [ENTITY] sparing other responsible persons including the respondent No. 1. Hence, if name of the present [ENTITY] and his involvement are not shown in said FIR, it does not mean that he is out of investigation and interrogation more particularly when his involvement has been established by way of documentary evidence. Over and above, if there is no allegation against him in the FIR, he should have remained present before the investigating agency and raised his grievance or defence before them. However, he was not available for investigation for a substantial long period of time and hence, to secure his presence for interrogation, proceedings under [SECTION] and [SECTION] were initiated. As [ENTITY] is not available for interrogation, there will not be any material which may reflect in the charge-sheet which has been admittedly filed qua other [ENTITY] wherein name of the present respondent No. 1 was shown as absconding [ENTITY]. On the one hand, the respondent No. 1 is not available for interrogation and investigation and on the other hand, he is asking the evidence to be shown against him in that charge-sheet. Besides, there are prima-facie evidence against the respondent No. 1 in the charge-sheet. In these circumstances, these contentions raised by the learned counsel for the respondent No. 1 all throughout are not tenable. Moreover, court below has dealt with these points which have become final between the parties. 20. Apart from the above, it was required for the court below to have considered the argument advanced by the learned Public Prosecutor there that lengthy typed FIR was prepared by the then Chairman of the bank involving only 60 people by sparing himself and other persons including directors and office bearers who were controlling the affairs of the bank and are prima-facie appear to have been involved in the crime in question. Not only that, the complainant has clearly stated in para 14 of the complaint that all directors, office bearers and others are innocent and affidavits affirmed by each and every directors are annexed with the complaint. Therefore also, it can be presumed that when the interested person files the complaint in order to save his skin and that of other real culprits, it is obvious that their names can be neither seen in the body of the FIR or in the entire FIR. Court below ought to have seen that it is during the course of investigation that the involvement of the present respondent No. 1-[ENTITY] and others have been prima-facie appeared."

            "24. Another point of the learned counsel for the respondent No. 1 has been that name of the present applicant has not been shown in the charge-sheet filed on 24-2-2003 qua [CASE NUMBER] as there is no evidence to connect to him with the crime in question. In this connection, it is required to be noted that when a well planned and well designed typed complaint was lodged by the Chairman, investigation has been done on that basis. Thereafter, when involvement of the respondent No. 1-[ENTITY] was seen during the course of investigation, he did not appear before the investigating agency for interrogation and hence, investigating agency could not investigate further into the matter. Meanwhile, as charge-sheet was required to be filed within the stipulated period qua other [ENTITY], it was filed showing the name of respondent No. 1-[ENTITY] and others as absconding which itself means non-availability of the [ENTITY] for investigation. In this view of the matter, obviously there will not be any name of the present respondent No. 1-[ENTITY] in the charge-sheet showing him as [ENTITY] but will be shown as absconding. Court below ought to have kept in mind the fact that once the persons were shown as absconding [ENTITY], there will not be much material to connect them with the crime in question as they could not collect the same due to non-availability of the [ENTITY]. As and when [ENTITY] would be available for investigation, upon interrogation and investigation of the [ENTITY], if there are materials to connect him with the offence, the investigating agency may file the supplementary charge-sheet and if there are none, they may even pray for appropriate summary to be filed. In the present case, materials are there on record against the respondent No. 1-[ENTITY] which are ignored by the court below. When cogent prima-facie documentary evidence are on record, court below ought not to have ignored the same without giving opportunity to the I.O. to interrogate or investigate into the matter."

It clearly appears from para 6 of the judgment that arguments have been advanced by learned P.P., Mr.[ENTITY], appearing in the court below but same have not been properly dealt with. On the one hand, court below is not providing opportunity to the prosecution to interrogate the [ENTITY] and on the other hand, it expects in para 8 by observing that court has to mainly see and observe whether any new development or any convincing evidence is gathered or collected so as to link the [ENTITY] with so-called offence committed by him. Without applying mind, the learned Sessions Judge has given a finding in para 8 that so-called statements of the persons arrested which are recorded by the I.O. during the investigation are vague and have no evidentiary value. This finding is factually incorrect. The statements relied upon by the prosecution before the court below and this Court are not the statements of arrested [ENTITY] but of the independent persons and bank employees recorded in explanatory form on factual aspects and, therefore, same cannot be ignored. Court below has also held that the statements relied upon by the prosecution are running contrary to the audit report submitted by Special Auditor and also other record of the bank. With pain, I would like to say that this finding given by the Sessions Judge is also contrary to the evidence on record. Without verifying the facts and going into the statements, learned Sessions Judge has jumped beyond the purview. Hence, said finding of the learned Sessions Judge appears to be perverse. Had the documentary evidence shown by the Public Prosecutor from the charge-sheet papers been taken into consideration, aforereferred conclusion would not have been arrived at by the learned Sessions Judge."

It appears that the present respondent No. 1-[ENTITY] has taken disadvantage of the process of law in as much as he being the pioneer of the bank led the bank into liquidation within a period of seven years and all amounts of the bank initially estimated at Rs.44.00 crores have been siphoned off after closure of the functioning of the bank by the respondent No. 1-[ENTITY], office bearers and others who are closely connected with the bank's activities. This requires serious investigation including the transaction of the complainant bank with the City Co-Operative Bank in presence of persons whose involvement is prima-facie established. It is in these circumstances that a joint interrogation of the [ENTITY], staff of the bank and other [ENTITY] is necessary for reaching the roots of the offence. Whatever arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the respondent No. 1 regarding the innocence of the [ENTITY] and reproduced in the affidavit would be available to the respondent No. 1-[ENTITY] at the time of trial or can be placed before the investigating agency during his interrogation. However, the present [ENTITY] has used the court machinery in such a manner that though the order has been confirmed by the High Court, instead of making himself available before the investigating agency, he was able to decide his matter through Court again on merits twice in the guise of change in circumstance."

            "30. It is required to be mentioned that in this case, while deciding the second successive anticipatory bail application of the respondent No. 1-[ENTITY], learned Sessions Judge has not taken into consideration the following aspects. Due to change in circumstance, party can approach the court below or the High Court under [SECTION] of the Code and court can deal with that point of change in circumstance only. However, the court cannot enter into the grounds which were previously contested by the parties and have become final. Here in this case, court below has violated the basic principle of law laid down by the Apex Court on this point by dealing with all points raised by the [ENTITY] in the first application filed under [SECTION] of the Code and which were already decided by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Surat, in detail with prima-facie reasons. Said order was carried further by the [ENTITY] in the High Court and at the end of arguments, it was withdrawn and hence it has become final between the parties and hence, learned Sessions Judge should not have dealt with the same points again in the successive anticipatory applications. The impugned order passed by the learned Sessions Judge also does not disclose as to why and in what circumstances said points were necessary to be dealt with again. Learned Sessions Judge has not properly dealt with the facts on record prima-facie involving the respondent [ENTITY] in the crime in question namely, bank record and statements of employees of the bank shown by the learned Public Prosecutor. Not only that, no satisfactory reasons have been assigned regarding the change in circumstance. Learned Sessions Judge has also failed to link the investigation with the audit report. It clearly appears that auditor has been appointed by the Government not for the purpose of investigation in question but for the whole scam of the bank to know the financial irregularities and position of the bank so as to decide about further course of action of the bank wherein complaint has been filed for individual offences which was required to be investigated in that manner. This aspect has also been ignored by the learned Judge. The act of the [ENTITY] was such which cannot be visualized on plan eye either by the auditor or by any person unless a detailed scrutiny of the transactions is done by the investigating agency and in these circumstances, the audit report cannot tilt the balance in favour of the [ENTITY]. Even in doing so, learned Judge has not given any cogent and satisfactory reasons. Moreover, reasons assigned by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge in the first order of anticipatory bail have not been properly dealt with. Over and above, court below has ignored various statements recorded by the investigating agency during the course of investigation as they are the statements of arrested persons. Such a baseless finding has been given by the learned Judge. Even if they are the statements of co-[ENTITY] or arrested persons, same cannot be discarded at this stage as they provide clue only to the investigating agency to proceed further into the matter. Hence, it was required for the learned Judge to have given permission to the investigating agency to proceed further on that basis and if the [ENTITY] is ultimately found to be innocent at the end of investigation, appropriate summary might be filed. However, investigating agency cannot be restrained by that baseless finding. Learned Sessions Judge has given much weight on the FIR and the charge-sheet submitted in the court qua other [ENTITY] on the ground of non-involvement of the respondent No. 1-[ENTITY] in the crime in question. As I have discussed earlier, it was a well planned and well designed typed FIR prepared by the then Chairman of the bank submitted to the Commissioner of Police, Surat, for the purpose of diverting the whole investigation for the purpose of saving real culprits as is conspicuous from para 14 of the complaint. Instead of going into the same, it has been used in favour of the [ENTITY] which is totally unwarranted. Learned Sessions Judge has also ignored the fact that charge-sheet submitted was qua other [ENTITY] against whom investigation was completed and, therefore, most of the evidence appearing in that charge-sheet will be connecting the [ENTITY] shown there and not the [ENTITY] shown in column No. 2 of the charge-sheet (summary sheet) as absconding [ENTITY]. It is thus clear that the [ENTITY] is not making himself available for investigation by filing various proceedings and is evading investigation to be done qua him. Still, however, he is seeking benefit on the ground that there are no evidence connecting him with the crime in question in the charge-sheet which is contrary to the settled law. Learned Sessions Judge has neglected the basic fact leading to the only conclusion of rejecting the second successive application that the [ENTITY] is not available for interrogation for a period of more than one year and for the purpose of securing his presence, prosecution has taken sufficient care by obtaining non-bailable warrant from the learned C.J.M., and initiating proceedings under [SECTION] and [SECTION] of the Code. Instead of taking into consideration all these aspects, learned Sessions Judge has interfered with the points which have become final between the parties. Merely because the respondent No. 1-[ENTITY] is having the political background and is connected with various social activities, learned Sessions Judge should not have exercised discretion in his favour. Learned Sessions Judge should not have taken into consideration the status of the person while passing the order. All these indicate the very act of a senior District and Sessions Judge not being in bone fade exercise of power."

She further submits that the 1st respondent had not even verified the authenticity of the claimant's identity and even without determining the entitlement of each claimant, only on the assumption that all the claimants are legal heirs of the deceased, passed the impugned Judgment. She further submits that there is no assessment of amounts to be paid on the basis of merits of the case by physically examining the applicants. She submits that all the OAs are at different stages of trial, but no opportunity was given to the petitioner for adducing evidence and it is very difficult to implement the common judgment passed by the 1st respondent, as different claims have been decided in a common judgment, without any proper determination. She also submits that Railway Claims Tribunal should decide all the claims as per [SECTION] of the [ACT], but the same has not been followed by the 1st respondent. She also submits that as per [SECTION] of the [ACT], the documents filed by the applicants have to be marked by the Railways Claims Tribunal, but no documents were marked by the 1st respondent."

They submit that as per [SECTION] of the [ACT], the Railways Tribunal has inherent power to pass such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the Tribunal.

The omission of the said fact in the affidavits filed in support of the Writ Petitions and the averment that they have no other alternative remedy except approaching this Court, amounts to suppression of material fact and that on this ground alone, all the Writ Petitions are liable to be dismissed. When the petitioners themselves have filed CMAs and same were pending as on the date of filing of the Writ Petitions, it cannot be said that the petitioners have no alternative remedy. It is pertinent to note that after filing of these writ petitions, the aforesaid CMAs are withdrawn, even without seeking liberty to file present writ petitions. Though alternate remedy is not a bar from maintaining Writ Petition, but in the present case, it is not the case of the petitioners that the 1st respondent lacks inherent jurisdiction to entertain the applications. The only grievance of the petitioners is that the impugned order is not passed in accordance with the provisions of the statute under which the applications are filed.

HEADNOTE: The Nagpur District Land Development Bank Ltd. was registered as a society under the [ACT], [SECTION]0. There was dispute as to whether one 'M' had been elected as a member of the Bank at a meeting of the Board of Directors. The Registrar of Cooperative Societies referred the dispute to a nominee. Certain documents including the minutes book of the Bank were produced before the nominee. 'M' filed a complaint against the President and Secretary of the Bank charging them with offences under [SECTION] and [SECTION] [ACT] for having forged the minute book and producing it before the nominee. The two accused raised an objection that the magistrate had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the complaint without the previous sanction of the Registrar of Cooperative Societies under [SECTION] of the Maharashtra Cooperative Bank Act, [SECTION]0. The trial magistrate rejected the contention. The order was confirmed by the Court of Session and the High Court Of Bombay. In appeal before this Court the following contentions were urged on behalf of the accused-appellants : (i) That the nominee of the Registrar appointed under [SECTION] of the [ACT], [SECTION]0, was a 'court' within the meaning of [SECTION] of the [ACT] and a complaint for offences under [SECTION] and [SECTION] [ACT] alleged to have be-en committed by a party to any proceeding in respect of the document produced or given in evidence in such proceeding, cannot be entertained except on a complaint in writing of such court, or of a court to which it is subordinate, (ii) That the ingredients of the offence of forgery punishable under [SECTION] [ACT] 'and of the offence under [SECTION] of the [ACT] are the same, and the general provision is on that account pro tanto repealed, and in any event in view of [SECTION] of the [ACT] no prosecution could be initiated in respect of the offences charged otherwise than with the sanction of the Registrar. HELD : (i) The nominee exercising power to make an award under [SECTION] of the [ACT], [SECTION]0, derives his authority not from the statute but from investment by the Registrar in his individual discretion. The power invested is liable to be suspended and may be withdrawn. He is not entrusted the judicial power of the State : he is merely an arbitrator authorised within the limits of the power conferred to 'adjudicate upon the dispute referred to him.

The Nagpur District Land Development Bank Ltd. is registered as a society under the Maharashtra Co-oPerative Societies Act, [SECTION]0. 'One [ENTITY] applied for membership of the Bank -as a \"non-borrowing member\". At a meeting of the Bank held on June 30, [SECTION]4, the application of [ENTITY] and of 94 others were granted and they were enrolled as members. But in the list of members entitled to take part in the General Meeting dated June 30, [SECTION]4 the names of [ENTITY] and others were not included. [ENTITY] and others then applied to the Registrar Co- operative Societies for an order declaring that they were entitled to participate in the election of office-bearers and for an injunction restraining the President and the Secretary from holding the annual General Meeting. The Registrar referred the dispute for adjudication under [SECTION] of the [ACT], [SECTION]0, to [ENTITY], his nominee. The nominee decided the dispute on May 7, [SECTION]5 and held that [ENTITY] and other applicants were members of the Bank. In the proceeding before the nominee certain documents including the minutes book of the Bank were produced. It is claimed by [ENTITY] that those 'books were fabricated by the President and the Secretary with a view to make it appear that [ENTITY] and other persons were never elected members of the Bank."

He had good service record and never gave any cause of complaint to the management. Management did not provide him legal facilities such as Providend Fund, Employee State Insurance contributions, gratuity, overtime allowance. Management also did not maintain his service record. When he demanded legal facilities management terminated his services [CASE NUMBER] 2 on 31.03.2004. He remained unemployed since the date of termination of his services.

Applicant examined himself as WW1 and thereafter close his evidence. 4. I have carefully perused the material available on the record and have hearded Authorized Representative for the workman. 5.

For purposes of the argument based on [SECTION] of the [ACT], we proceed, as contended by the learned counsel, on the assumption that the State has made special provision for reservation of scats for scheduled caste/tribe candidates and that for their admission no minimum marks have been fixed as qualifying marks. After having heard learned counsel, we are of opinion that the admission of the scheduled caste and scheduled Tribe Candidates in the circumstances mentioned above is saved by [SECTION], and is valid. [SECTION] bars discrimination and enjoins that the State shall not discriminate against any citizen on the ground of religion, race, caste, sex place of birth or any of them. [SECTION] makes Clause (1) inapplicable if the State makes any special provision for the advancement of socially or eductationally backward classes of citizens or for members of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. The Union of India by making a special provision for admission of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe candidates to technological Institutions must be held to have done so for securing their advancement. Such a provision will be within the scope of [SECTION] and will thus not be hit either by [SECTION] or [SECTION] of the [ACT]. The purpose of reservation of seats in technological Institutions is to make them available for scheduled caste and scheduled Tribe candidates as they cannot be available to them without such reservation. Once reservation has been made the method of filling up of reserved seats may be different from the one adopted for filling up to unreserved seats. The qualifying marks for this class may also be different or there may be no qualifying marks at all."

Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that by admitting candidates who do not acquire even 40% marks which according to him are qualifying marks in the examination for all candidates, the standard of Engineers and Technologists coming out of these Institutions will be much lower and will ultimately affect the welfare of the people. We are not impressed by this argument. It is only at the stage of admission that concession is granted to the people belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. No concession is being granted to them in passing the final examination; unless they qualify themselves through the education given to them at the Institute they will not pass and the country will not get technologists and engineers who are not fully qualified."

The young widow with a minor son of three months and parents of deceased have brought this claim petition. 2. The proceedings were initially under DAR format and since matter could not have been settled in that proceeding, a claim petition was filed.

As per the claim of the petitioners deceased [ENTITY] at the time of accident was working as a driver and petitioners have examined [ENTITY] employer of the deceased as PW-1. PW-2 [ENTITY] is one of the petitioner and father of the deceased. PW-3 [ENTITY] is the Uncle of the deceased. He was riding as a pillion on the motorcycle of deceased at the time of the accident. PW-4 [ENTITY] is the widow of deceased [ENTITY]. 5. The owner and driver have also filed their affidavit of evidence. Owner [ENTITY] has been examined as R1W1. Driver [ENTITY] has been examined as R2W1. The owner has produced one driving license of [ENTITY] driver issued from Fatehgarh Licensing Authority alongwith the verification report which confirms to the genuineness of this driving license. To the similar effect is the statement of [ENTITY] who has filed his affidavit Ex.R2 and has been examined as R2W1. 6. The Insurance Company is disputing and denying the liability of payment. The Insurance Company in support has examined one witness [ENTITY] Assistant Manager Legal. His affidavit of evidence is Ex.R3W1/1. 7. Heard. Issue wise disposal of the inquiry is as under. [CASE NUMBER] 3/14 ISSUE NO.1 8. The wife of the deceased has been examined as PW-4. She has filed copy of her Election I Card in order to prove her relationship with the deceased [ENTITY]. Copy of birth certificate of son of deceased who is P2 [ENTITY] has also been placed on record in which name of his parents has been mentioned as [ENTITY] i.e. deceased and Petitioner no.1 [ENTITY]. Copy of election I card of the parents alongwith copy of the ration card of deceased are also on record. All these documents are sufficient to hold that petitioners are related to deceased [ENTITY]. No other person has been coming forward to claim any right, title or interest in the property of the deceased. As such it is held that all the four petitioners are the only surviving legal heirs of deceased [ENTITY]. Even the respondents are not disputing that there is any other legal heirs tot he deceased [ENTITY] other than these petitioners. Issue no.1 is disposed of accordingly. ISSUE NO.2 9. The testimony of PW-3 [ENTITY] is relevant for this issue. [ENTITY] is the uncle of the deceased. FIR has been recorded on the statement of PW-3 [ENTITY]. At the time of the accident [ENTITY] was sitting with deceased [ENTITY] on his motorcycle as pillion and both were moving towards Gurgaon. As per PW-3 when they reached at NH-24 Pandav Nagar the offending truck came from behind and hit the motorcycle. [ENTITY] died at the spot. The accident is of 4.30 p.m. At that time it is supposed that there must be sufficient natural light. The driver of the truck has not been vigilant and careful in driving of the [CASE NUMBER] 4/14 offending truck. He was driving a heavy vehicle and he should have maintained a proper distance from the other vehicles on road by keeping the speed of the truck under his control. The deceased [ENTITY] is another victim of a road accident because of careless driving of the truck driver R2. It is a case of res-ipse-loquitor. The driver of the truck has been arrested at the spot itself. His name also figures in the FIR. In [PRECEDENT] it was held that registration of a criminal case against the driver of the offending vehicle is enough to record the finding that the driver of offending vehicle is responsible for causing the accident. Accordingly issue no.2 is disposed of holding that petitioners have brought sufficient material on record proving that this accident has been caused because of rash and negligent driving of the driver [ENTITY] of the truck taking away a young life who was hardly married for more than a year's time and was father of a three months old son. The loss is tragic and irreparable to the family of the deceased. ISSUE NO.3 10. The copy of educational certificate of the deceased has been placed on record. It shows that deceased was a Matriculate and his date of birth was 5.8.1984. Date of accident is 2.7.2010. At the time of the accident age of the deceased [ENTITY] was 25 plus. According to the petitioners, deceased was working as a driver and was drawing salary of Rs. 9250/- p.m. In order to prove this fact petitioners have examined [ENTITY] proprietor R.P. Tempo Service. According to PW-1 deceased was working with him as a driver and he was being paid Rs. [CASE NUMBER] 5/14 9000/- as salary and Rs. 250/- as mobile charges. PW-1 has proved the salary certificate of deceased as Mark A. 11. The fact of salary of the deceased being Rs. 9250/- p.m. has been disputed and denied by the counsel for the insurance company submitting that salary certificate Mark A proved by PW-1 cannot be relied upon in absence of any other supportive material produced by PW-1 like attendance register, payment register, mode of payment or the income tax record. 12. For the reason of deficiencies pointed out by the counsel for the Insurance Company it is difficult to rely upon on the document Mark A of salary proved by PW-1. The compensation under the head of loss of dependency has to be assessed on the basis of the minimum wages for a matriculate as deceased was a matriculate as per the document of education filed on record. The school certificate shown to have been issued from the Board of Secondary Education, Haryana. The minimum wages for a matriculate on the date of accident were Rs. 6448/-. Considering the increase in minimum wages due to price index and inflation rate the average of minimum wage of Rs. 6448/- and its double be taken it comes to Rs. 9672/-. Since the family of the deceased consist of wife, parents and one son 1/4th has to be deducted on account of personal expenses. The multiplier of 17 be applied according to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of [PRECEDENT]. The total loss of dependency comes to Rs. 7254 X 12 X 17 = Rs. 14,79,816/-. [CASE NUMBER] 6/14 13 Petitioners are also awarded a compensation of the amount of Rs. 40,000/- under the conventional heads of loss of consortium for petitioner no.1, loss of love and affection, loss of estate and also for meeting out the funeral charges for all the petitioners. 14. Keeping in view all the relevant factors and evidence on record this Tribunal is of the view that the petitioners are entitled for compensation as per following details. 1. Loss of dependency : Rs. 14,79,816/- 2. Loss of consortium, loss of love & affection, : Rs. 40,000/- Loss of estate & Funeral expenses"

The Insurance Company in this case has been denying its liability of payment for the reason that driver [ENTITY] was having more than two licenses which is prohibited under [SECTION] of the [ACT]. According to the counsel the driver [ENTITY] has produced one driving license to the police issued from Mathura Licensing Authority which on verification was found fake by the police and as such the second license produced by him thereafter issued from Fatehgarh Authority even if verified by the police and found to be genuine is only to be rejected for the reason that the driver has not produced anything on record to show that he was ever a resident of the area of Fatehgarh or was running his business in the jurisdiction of that Authority which is the condition precedent for the purpose of issuing of a license under [SECTION] of the Act.

The plea of the Insurance Company was that it was a case of gratuitous passengers and as such Tribunal has no statutory power to direct the Insurance Company to pay the compensation in view of fundamental breach of the policy conditions. It was held that purposive interpretation of [SECTION] of the Act would make it manifest that the provision relates to power of the Tribunal to determine the question of justness of the award and quantum of compensation but it does not empower the Tribunal to issue to issue direction to the insurer to pay the amount of compensation though a finding is reached that the insurer is not liable to pay such amount on account of fundamental breach of the terms of insurance policy."

The Insurance Company did not lead any evidence that accident was caused due to the negligence of the driver or cause of the accident was disqualification of the driver to drive passenger vehicle.

When an owner after verification has satisfied himself that the driver has a valid license and was driving the vehicle in question competently at the time of the accident there would be no breach of [SECTION], in that event, the insurance company would not then be absolved of liability. Mere absence of, fake or invalid driving licence or disqualification of the driver for driving at the relevant time, are not in themselves defences available to the insurer against either the insured or the third parties.

In view of this preposition as laid down in the above said case of the Apex Court and applying the same to the instant case, it may be noted that offending vehicle in the case in hand was admittedly insured with R3 Reliance General Ins. Co. Insurance company did not produce any evidence to show that the owner [ENTITY] R1 was aware of the fake driving license of driver [ENTITY] R2. The owner has produced one driving license of driver [ENTITY] issued from Fatehgarh License Authority genuineness of which is not in dispute. The plea of the Insurance Company that the driver cannot posses more than one license is not available to the Insurance Company against owner unless the Insurance Company is able to bring on record to show that the owner is aware of the fact of the two licenses or more with the driver. No such evidence has been brought on record by the Insurance Company. In cross examination by the Insurance Company the owner appearing as R1W1 has specifically denied of his having knowledge of any other license other than the one produced by him. In cross examination owner R1W1 has stated that [ENTITY] was driver with him from last about 7 years and according to him he did not find anything suspicious either with his driving or about his driving license. There is no evidence brought by the Insurance Company on record to prove that the owner has knowingly given the vehicle to drive to driver [ENTITY] despite his having knowledge that he is not properly authorized to drive the same or was having a fake license."

            "Order on Bail Application in Criminal Appeal No. 4194 of 2016 This bail application has been moved by the appellant - accused [ENTITY] for being released on bail during pendency of appeal filed against the judgment and order dated 30/6/2016 passed in [CASE NUMBER] (State vs [ENTITY]) arising out of [CASE NUMBER], PS Gwaltoli, District Kanpur Nagar, whereby accused has been awarded punishment under [SECTION] [ACT] of 10 years rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs. 1 lakh and in default of payment of fine additional rigorous imprisonment of one year The facts of the case as gathered from the certified copy of the judgment enclosed are that the police party headed by SO, [ENTITY] were busy in checking of 2 wheelers. At 19.30 one person riding a scooter was indicated to stop, but instead of stopping the vehicle he accelerated the same and as a result of that he fell down and was caught. He disclosed his name to be [ENTITY] and confessed that he had 8 Kg [ENTITY] in a bag kept in the scooter and beneath the petrol tank he had a cavity, in which he had kept 1 Kg [ENTITY]. He was apprised of his right to be searched in front of the Gazetted Officer or Magistrate, but he declined and opted to be searched by them only. Upon being searched, 8 Kg [ENTITY] in four packets and 1 Kg [ENTITY] in the fifth one (2 packets of half Kg each) was recovered. He failed to produce any licence to keep them. Besides this Rs. 1000/- in the currency of 100 rupee denomination was also recovered. He also stated that he supplies this material to his customers in the city, peddling the same. The said recovered material was weighed and it was found to be 1 KG [ENTITY] and 8 KGs [ENTITY]. The separate samples were taken of 50 - 50 grams each. The accused was apprised that he had committed an offence under [SECTION] of [ACT] and needed to be arrested. The recovered [ENTITY] and the currency notes were sewn in a cloth while [ENTITY] was kept back in the same bag and was sewn and both the items were separately sealed and samples of seals were prepared. No one from the public became ready to be a witness of this recovery fearing incurring enmity. The recovery memorandum was prepared on the spot and a copy of the same was given to the accused after obtaining his signature thereon."

No public witness has been sought to be taken at the time of recovery from the accused. It was also not brought on record as to from who the balance (weighing machine) was brought for weighing the recovered material. No proof of the police party being dispatched from the police station has been produced. The compliance of [SECTION] of the [ACT] has been violated by not apprising the accused of his right that he could opt to be searched before the Gazetted Officer/Magistrate. The scooter, in which the alleged contraband is shown to have been concealed, has not been seized. The accused has already been in jail for 3 long years and there is no likelihood of the appeal being heard in near future due to heavy docket."

It is further stated that the rest of the arguments made are not significant in view of heavy recovery of commercial quantity of contraband which was not likely to be planted. It was admitted that it was not mentioned in the recovery memo as to from where the weighing machine was obtained for weighing the contraband, but it was submitted that if there was any such doubt regarding recovery of the contraband, all these questions ought to have been put by the learned counsel of the appellant during the trial before lower Court, at least by placing such suggestions to the witnesses examined.

Having regard to the scheme of the Act and the context in which it has been used in the section, it naturally means a human being or living individual unit and not an artificial person. The word has to be understood in a broad common sense manner and, therefore, not a naked or nude body of a human being but the manner in which a normal human being will move about in a civilised society. Therefore, the most appropriate meaning of the word \"person\" appears to be - \"the body of a human being as presented to public view usually with its appropriate coverings and clothings\". In a civilised society, appropriate coverings and clothings are considered absolutely essential and no sane human being comes in the gaze of others without appropriate coverings and clothings. The appropriate coverings will include footwear also as normally it is considered an essential article to be worn while moving outside one's home. Such appropriate coverings or clothings or footwear, after being worn, move along with the human body without any appreciable or extra effort. Once worn, they would not normally get detached from the body of the human being unless some specific effort in that direction is made. For interpreting the provision, rare cases of some religious monks and sages, who, according to the tenets of their religious belief do not cover their body with clothings, are not to be taken notice of.

One of the tests, which can be applied is, where in the process of search, the human body comes in contact with or shall have to be touched by the person carrying out search, it will be search of a person. Some indication of this is provided by [SECTION] of the Act, which provides that no female shall be searched by anyone excepting the female. The legislature has consciously made this provision as while conducting search of a female, her body may come in contact or may need to be touched and, therefore, it should be done only by a female. In the case of a bag, briefcase or any other article or container, etc., they would not normally move along with the body of the human being unless some extra or a special effort is made.

From its perusal it is apparent that this is a case in which the accused came in contact with the police party, which was busy in checking of vehicles at about 19.30 hrs. when the accused aboard a scooter drove towards Company Bagh intersection; he was instructed to stop, but he accelerated his motor towards Anand Palace, seeing the police. Becoming suspicious about him, the police party chased him, as a result of which he fell down and was caught. Thus it was sudden arrest. When he disclosed to be in possession of illegal [ENTITY] and [ENTITY] he was offered to be searched in presence of a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate, but the accused declined and consented to be searched by the police party itself. It is also mentioned that the recovered contraband was sealed in separate bundles after taking out samples of 50 grams each which were separately sealed and the sample seal were also prepared . The sample was sent to forensic science lab, Lucknow in sealed condition, and both were respectively found to be [ENTITY] and [ENTITY]. The Court below has given a clear finding that the recovered contraband remained in sealed condition right from the moment it was recovered till it was examined by the FSL, hence there was no occasion for any kind of tampering to be made with the sample or the main packets which was lodged in the Malkhana. The small variation in the weight of the samples has not been found material by the Court below because they were weighed as 48 gram [ENTITY] and 54 gram [ENTITY] in the lab while according to prosecution 50 grams of each were sent there. It is also recorded in the judgment that after arrest of the accused with the said contraband, higher authorities were informed through RT set. It is also come on record that a report in this regard was also presented by SHO [ENTITY] (paper number 11 Ka/9) before SSP [ENTITY]. Hence compliance of [SECTION] of the [ACT] also appears to have been made. The Court below has not found any kind of lacuna serious enough not to find the accused guilty. It is also apparent that the quantity recovered from the accused is much higher than the lower limit of the commercial quantity of charas and [ENTITY], which would be difficult to be planted taking into consideration its high cost/price."

To deal with the menace of dangerous drugs flooding the market, the Parliament has provided that a person accused of offence under this Act should not be released on bail during trial unless the mandatory conditions provided under [SECTION], that there are reasonable grounds for holding that the accused is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail, are satisfied. So far as the first condition is concerned, apparently the accused has been found guilty and has been convicted.

In the meantime, the Sub Inspector received a secret information that [ENTITY] accused and [ENTITY] accused were doing the business of selling the charas and now they have brought charas from [ENTITY] and standing at Red Light Chowk, Old Panchkula in wait of a bus. If a raid is conducted, they could be caught red handed. The information was reduced into writing and sent to Shri [ENTITY], Deputy Superintendent of Police, City Panchkula. The Sub Inspector formed a raiding party and reached at the said place. On being given signal by the informant, two young persons were intercepted by the police party. On asking, one narrated his name as [ENTITY], who was holding a black coloured raxine bag in his hand. The other one disclosed his name to be [ENTITY], who was having a light blue coloured cloth bag in his hand. The contents of their bags being suspected to be contraband, these accused were served with notice under [SECTION] of the Act thereby calling upon them to tell as to whether they want to be searched before a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate. They opted to be searched before a Gazetted Officer. Meanwhile, [ENTITY], DSP Police, City Panchkula made search of the bag of [ENTITY]. On search, charas duly wrapped in a yellow polythene envelope was recovered from his bag. When the same was weighed, it came to 3 Kgs. Two samples of 25 grams each were drawn and converted into parcels. The remainder was also turned into a parcel. These parcels were sealed with seals `SK' and `RD' and seized vide separate memo. On search of the bag in the possession of accused [ENTITY], 2 Kg. charas duly wrapped in a yellow polythene envelope yielded. Two samples of 25 grams each were separated and converted into parcels. The residue was also made into a parcel. These parcels were also sealed with the above-mentioned seals and taken into possession vide separate memo. The seal SK after use was handed over to [ENTITY] Constable, whereas DSP retained his seal with him. [ENTITY] was sent to the Police Station, where on its basis, formal FIR was registered.

The investigator had given the option to the appellants to be searched before him, or a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate, which shows that the mandatory provisions of the Act have not been complied with in stricto senso. He has sought to place reliance upon the observations rendered in re: [ENTITY] v. State of H.P., 2008(4) Recent Criminal Reports (Criminal) 563. This contention merits rejection. As a matter of fact, the thrust of his argument is that if the accused were offered to have the search of their person from a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate, the provisions of [SECTION] ought to have been adhered to in view of [ENTITY] & Another v. State of M.P., 2007(1) Recent Criminal Reports (Criminal) 586. In a nutshell, his submission is that by asking the appellants to have the search of their bodies from him, the investigator has violated the mandatory provisions of [SECTION]. This contention is bereft of any merit. In re: [ENTITY] & Another's case (supra), the recovery was effected from scooter. The accused were informed about their right to have their personal search. It was in these circumstances held that once personal search is offered though the recovery has been effected from the bag or some other article, the provisions should be observed in stricto senso. In re: [ENTITY]'s case (supra), it has been held that the accused should be made aware that he has right to be searched before a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer. Although, such communication itself may not necessarily be made in writing but as far as possible, such communication should be made in the presence of some independent and respectable person witnessing the arrest and search. In the instant case ([ENTITY]'s case), though search was made before a Magistrate, but accused was not informed of his right of search before Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate. It was in these circumstances held in [ENTITY]'s case (supra), that the provisions of [SECTION] have not been complied with and the conviction was set aside. In the present one, it has been admitted on behalf of the appellants that the appellants were apprised of their right to have their personal search in the presence of a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate. Additionally, the Investigator had asked the appellants to tell if they want to have their search from him. Axiomatically, the provisions of [SECTION] stand complied with in stricto senso. The case of the prosecution cannot be thrown out of hand merely because the Investigator out of abundant caution has additionally asked the appellants that if they want, they can have search from him.

The [ENTITY], 2008(2) Recent Criminal Reports (Criminal) 264, there was a delay of one month in sending sample to the Forensic Science Laboratory. There was no evidence that samples of the case property were tampered with. The seals on the samples, tallied with the specimen seal as per the forwarding authority letter. Under these circumstances, it was held by this Court that mere delay in sending the samples did not, in any way cause prejudice to the accused, nor did it go to prove that the samples were tampered with, until the same were deposited in the Office of Forensic Science Laboratory. Further in re: [PRECEDENT], there was a delay of 10 days in sending the samples to the Forensic Science Laboratory. It was held by the Division Bench of this Court that mere delay in sending the same to the laboratory is not fatal, when there is evidence that the seized articles were kept in proper and safe custody. Further in re: [ENTITY] son of [ENTITY], resident of Haraj, Police Station Sheela Ganj, District Moti Hari (Bihar) v. The [ENTITY], 2009(2) Recent Criminal Reports (Criminal) 39, there was a delay of 7 days in sending the sample to the Forensic Science Laboratory. The delay was not explained. It was held that the prosecution has led cogent and convincing evidence that the sample was not tampered with during the period and thus, the delay was not fatal to the prosecution. Again in Motia Bai v. [ENTITY], 2005(3) Recent Criminal Reports (Criminal) 56, there was a delay of 20 days in sending the sample to the Forensic Science Laboratory. There was no evidence that the sample was tampered with. The report of the Forensic Science Laboratory indicated that the seals of the sample were intact, when it reached the laboratory. The conviction was upheld. In re: State of Orissa v. Kanduri Sahoo, 2004(1) Supreme Court Cases 337, the sample of cannabis (ganja) was sent for chemical examination after four days of recovery. It was observed by the Apex Court that \"The evidence of PW-1 was categorical to the effect that the articles were kept in the Excise Malkhana from where they were brought and sent for chemical examination. This relevant aspect appears to have been missed by the High Court. In [PRECEDENT]'s case (supra), it was not laid down that whenever there is delay in sending the samples, the prosecution version would become vulnerable. What was emphasised related to proper and safe custody of the seized articles. In the background to that particular case, when delay of 3 months was there and there was no clear evidence as to with whom the articles were lying, the decision was rendered. No evidence was led to show that the contraband articles were in proper custody and in proper form. But the factual situation is different here. That being so, the High Court's judgment does not stand scrutiny and is set aside. The conviction as done by the trial Court was proper.\" It was also held that merely because the articles were kept in the excise malkhana for four days would not make the prosecution version suspect."

Presuming that the CFSL form was not prepared at the spot and was prepared when the police party after recovery had returned to the Police Station, that does not create any doubt about the recoveries of the contraband from the appellants. The Court has to adopt a pragmatic approach while considering the spot investigations. Fair and impartial investigation is no doubt sacrosanct, but rituals of investigation cannot be insisted upon unless strict compliance of such rituals is prescribed by statutes. There is no rule of evidence or procedural laws under [ACT] or [ACT] that every document must be prepared on the spot of recovery. It is not the requirement of law that the entire investigation must be completed on the spot and no part of writing work can be done by the Investigating Agency in the Police Station or at any other place.

This document clearly shows that amount of debt is crystallized and admitted. The judgment of Supreme Court reported in M/s Madhusudan [ENTITY] and Com. Vs. Madhu Woollen Industries Pvt. Ltd.- (1971) 3 SCC-632 is relied upon to contend that when debt is not bonafidely disputed and defense is not substantial one, the court will have to pass necessary order for winding-up the company. It is held that where debt is undisputed, the court will not act upon the defense that the company has ability to pay the debt but the company chooses not to pay that particular debt. If the defense is not likely to succeed in points of law, the defense cannot be treated as substantial. Shri [ENTITY] placed reliance on [PRECEDENT] bolster his submission that when a notice was issued under [SECTION] of the Act and same is not replied, it can be safely concluded that amount was due and company is unable to pay the debt. Even otherwise, [SECTION] of the Act does not state that debt must be precisely a definite sum. On the strength of [PRECEDENT]), it is argued that dispute/ defense would be substantial and genuine if it is bonafide and not spurious, speculative, illusory or misconceived. The company court, at this stage, is not expected to hold the full trial of the matter. The court must decide whether the grounds appear to be substantial. The grounds of dispute must not consistent on some ingenious mask invented to deprive just and honest entitlement and must not be a mere wrangle. The judgment of Bombay High Court [PRECEDENT] known as Camber India Pvt. Ltd.) and judgment of this court reported in (2013) 4 MPLJ-409 ([PRECEDENT] is relied upon to advance a contention that when defense of the other side is a camouflage and debt is undisputed, the winding up is the only option.

The petitioner always insisted upon advance payment. Only after making payment and issuance of delivery order, coal could be lifted by the respondents. The respondents made payment of Rs.1,29,28,000/- by RTGS towards advance payment of 5,000 MT. The copy of cheque is filed as Annexure R/21. Further amount of Rs.50,000/- was paid by respondent by cheque dated 13.10.2013 (Annexure R/22).

Ex.D is merely a bill of lading which shows that 10,000 MT of coal had reached to Kandala port but this document is not an evidence of supply of 10,000 MT coal to the respondents. The respondent averred that he has already made payment of Rs.1,29,28,000/- and Rs.50,00,000/- to the petitioner whereas the petitioner-company has supplied only 6008.98 MT coal and still in possession of an amount of Rs.24,82,611/- for which no coal has been supplied. The respondent, in fact, must get the balance of 696.770 MT of coal amounting to Rs.24,82,611/- for which no stock is available with the petitioner. The respondents have filed Annexure R/23 to show the quantity of coal supplied by the petitioner and delivery to the respondents. It is submitted that no further coal was made available.

The contention of petitioner was that the statutory notice send by petitioner under [SECTION] of the Act was not replied by the respondent and, therefore, because of deeming provision it can be safely concluded that: (i) the amount is admitted and crystallized; and (ii) the respondent-Company is unable to pay the debt. These points require serious consideration. This is trite that in order to raise presumption under [SECTION] of the Act as a company's inability to pay its debt, it is not sufficient to show merely that the company has omitted to pay the debt due to petitioner despite service of the statutory notice, it must show that company has omitted to pay without reasonable excuse. [See: [PRECEDENT], (Inre Fedral Chemical Works Ltd.)]. The Delhi High Court in [PRECEDENT] held that there is a fallacy in the argument that if statutory notice is not replied, it should be deeded that respondent has ignored to pay its debt. The Delhi High Court further held that mere omission of respondent to comply with the statutory notice and not sending any reply to the communication would not mean that respondent has admitted the liability. Similarly, in [PRECEDENT], it was again held that no conclusion can be drawn that winding up order must invariably be passed where no response to statutory notice has been made. This Court in the order dated 27.09.2016 passed in [PRECEDENT] opined that inability to pay debts in terms of [SECTION], may raise a presumption as to inability to pay its debt, but such a presumption is rebuttable. Such a presumption may be rebutted on existing material and based on evidence which may be sufficient in the facts and circumstances of the case. In view of said judgments, I am of considered view that as a thumb rule it cannot be said that merely because reply to said statutory notice was not given by the respondent, the debt is either admitted or presumption can be drawn that respondent is unable to pay the debt."

Ltd., 1865 (35) Beava 204 was considered by the Supreme Court and it was held \"again, the petition for winding up by a creditor who claimed payments of agreed a sum for work done for the company when the company contended that the work had not been properly, was not allowed\"; (iii) when defence is substantial and it is not like a moonshine, winding up is not appropriate remedy. Thus, the core issue is whether the debt is bonafide disputed and defence is substantial one or it is merely a moonshine. The petitioner placed reliance on lading memo (Annexure-E) to contend that 10,000 mt. coal was delivered at the port. The document dated 13th October, 2014 (Ex.J) is heavily relied up on to submit that the liability/debt was crystallized and admitted. However, if this contention is examined in juxtaposition to the defence, it will be clear that there is no such admission regarding debt. There exits no such crystallization or admission of the amount. The parties are at loggerheads on the question of supply of the coal. The petitioner contended that amount of Rs.79,28,000/-, paid through cheque was in relation to coal already supplied, whereas respondent contended that it was the advance payment for the coal which was yet to be supplied and such coal was actually never supplied because no such supply is preceded by issuance of a delivery order. The delivery order was never issued nor filed in this case. Thus, in my view, there exits a serious dispute between the parties on this aspect. Therefore, the defence of the respondent, in my considered view cannot be said to be an artificial defence. It is a bonafide defence. This defence cannot be treated as a mask, a camouflage or a smoke screen created by it to hide the reality. The ancillary question is whether in such a case, winding up proceeding is the appropriate remedy. In [PRECEDENT], it was held that a debt under [SECTION] must be determined or a definite sum of money. Expression \"unable to pay its debt\" in [SECTION] of the Act should be taken in the commercial sense. The machinery for winding up will not be allowed to be utilized merely as a means for realizing debts due from a company. It was further held that where defence raised is a substantial one and not mere moonshine, it is to be finally adjudicated upon merits before the appropriate forum. If legal history on this point is traced in relation to winding up of the company, it will be profitable to see that in the case of [PRECEDENT], it was held by the Supreme Court that if a debt is not paid on account of a bona fide dispute, the same cannot be treated as inability to pay the debt. Similarly, in the case of Madhusudan [ENTITY] & Co. v. Madhu Woolen Industries Private Ltd., (1971) 3 SCC 632, it was held that the relief of winding up cannot be granted in a case where the debt is bona fide disputed and the defence is substantial one. It was further held that the principles on which the Court while dealing with the petition for winding up of the company bears in mind are that the defence of the company is in good faith and one of substance and the defence is likely to succeed in point of law and the company adduces prima-facie proof of the facts on which the defence depends. In the case of [PRECEDENT], it has been held that the creditor in order to seek winding up of a company must prove that the debt is clear and unimpeachable in law and the debt must have been crystallized. It has further been held that if the accounts are not settled, the debt cannot be said to have crystallized."

            "24. In the case of [PRECEDENT]), it has been held that to raise a presumption of a company's inability to pay its debts it is not enough merely to show that the company has omitted to pay the debt despite service of statutory notice, it must be further shown that the company omitted to pay without reasonable excuse and conditions of insolvency in the commercial sense exist. In the case of [PRECEDENT], it has been held by the Supreme Court that where there is a bona fide dispute as to the liability to pay the amount of debt, it is the duty of the Court to ascertain the cause for refusal to pay the debt and invocation of [SECTION] of the Act is impermissible. The said view is taken by this Court in [PRECEDENT]]."

Even, as the guilt of an accused person may be proved by the testimony of a single witness, the innocence of the accused may be established by the testimony of a single witness, even though a considerable number of witnesses may be forthcoming to testify to the truth of the case for the prosecution.

            "Precedent",
            "\"13. How can the court find out bona fides of a decision taken by the Prosecutor at the request of the Government to withdraw from prosecution? Certainly, the decision taken by the Prosecutor is the outcome of a thinking process wherein the facts of the Prosecution case and the reasons for seeking consent to withdraw from prosecution are the inputs. Mere assertion of the Public Prosecutor that he had independently applied his mind in good faith uninfluenced by any extraneous consideration or mere adoption of certain expressions like 'Public Interest' or 'Public Policy' apparently incompatible with facts of the prosecution case, in the application seeking consent for withdrawal from prosecution is neither sufficient nor satisfactory to grant consent. The bona fides and independence of the decision taken by Public Prosecutor at the request of the Government could have manifested in the decision itself, in view of fact of the prosecution case and reasons relied on for withdrawal from prosecution. As the ultimate repository under [SECTION] of the [ACT], it is for the court to verify the veracity and credibility of the said averments in view of the decision taken thereon. The said verification and granting or declining of consent will come under judicial function. It follows that the court can exercise judicial discretion either granting or declining consent. The decision taken by the Public Prosecutor at the request of the Government to withdraw from prosecution must be logical, rationale and compatible with the facts of the prosecution case and reasons for withdrawal from prosecution. It is needless to say that where the decision appears otherwise, it can be held that the decision taken by the Public Prosecutor is improper and sans bona fides and independence.\""

            "12. The substratum of the principles enunciated in the above decisions can be summarised as follows: The basic principle underlying all the grounds for withdrawal must be that the withdrawal can be sought only for furthering the cause of public justice. The main question to be considered is whether the Public Prosecutor has applied his mind independently in good faith, uninfluenced by irrelevant and extraneous consideration. It must be satisfied that withdrawal will serve public interest. \"At the same time, it is not for the court to weigh the material or decide whether prosecution will end in conviction or acquittal as if it is exercising the appellate jurisdiction over the decision of the Prosecutor. But \"the court must be satisfied that the Public Prosecutor has considered the materials in good faith, reached the conclusion that his withdrawal from prosecution will serve the public interest\". The court must also consider whether the grant of consent may thwart or stifle the course of law or result in manifest injustice."

Coming to the instant case, on an analysis of the reasons enumerated from one to ten in the impugned order under challenge as well as in paragraph 5 to 8 in the application, it could be seen that the basic reason underlying in all ground is one and the same, that is, the paucity of evidence. According to the prosecution, there is no sufficient evidence to make sure that the prosecution would end in conviction."

        [
            "Court Reasoning",
            "14. In view of the above principle enunciated by plethora of decisions laid down by the Supreme Court, let us examine the legality and propriety of the findings in the impugned order. In the above decisions also, the Apex Court has specifically stated that the question whether the prosecution will end in conviction or acquittal cannot be looked into while taking a decision to withdraw from prosecution. But, here apparently, the said aspect, which cannot be taken as a ground alone has been taken as a ground for withdrawal. At this stage, there cannot be a mini-trial for a scrutiny as to whether there can be a successful prosecution or not. It is interesting to note that the very same Prosecutor had applied his mind while approving the charge at the time of filing the final report. After sometime, the very same Prosecutor has turned round and filed application stating the defects in the investigation and lack of evidence and also on a finding that a successful prosecution is not possible. I am unable to find any provisions in the [ACT] enabling the Prosecutor to conduct such a mini-trial in his own mind after filing the final report and before the commencement of trial. In the above context, the submission of the counsel appearing for the de facto complainant/ 7th respondent that the accused are influential persons in the locality and the Public Prosecutor has not applied his mind independently in good faith and he applied his mind under the influence of the accused who are power full persons in the locality assumes significance, and such a possibility cannot be brushed aside."
        ],
        [
            "Court Reasoning",
            "15. The learned counsel for the respondents 1 to 4 submits that the alleged act was committed for widening a road in the locality and the accused are social workers in the locality. Therefore, there lies a public interest in encroaching and causing damages in the property of the de facto complainant and others. I am afraid and unable to countenance the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the respondents 1 to 4. Whatever be the aim and object of the trespass and encroachment and whoever be the person trespassed and encroached the property of another person, that act cannot be treated as an act in furtherance of the public interest. For widening of a road, there is a procedure established under law. If that be so, encroaching the property of another person by taking law into their own hands cannot be taken as an act committed for public interest. As noted by the learned Magistrate in the instant case in the application seeking withdrawal, the Public Prosecutor has no case that the withdrawal is for public interest or public justice. The paramount consideration in an application seeking consent for withdrawing prosecution is, whether the consent for withdrawing prosecution is sought for public interest or public justice ? Here, undoubtedly, this question can be answered negatively. The prosecution also has no such case of public interest. But, per contra, the alleged act committed by the accused is against the interest of the persons who own property on both sides of the road. In fact, withdrawing from prosecution of the accused is against public interest and public peace. So, I am of the opinion that if the court grants consent for withdrawing the prosecution of the accused, the common man will loose their confidence in Rule of law. As rightly held by the learned Magistrate withdrawal of the prosecution will definitely result in more serious consequences, which will adversely affect public peace. Therefore, I also concur with the findings of the court below that the Public Prosecutor has not applied his mind in good faith uninfluenced by any extraneous consideration independently. Consequently, I confirm the impugned order under challenge. The court below is directed to proceed with the case in accordance with law."

            "[8]. The respondents were very much privy to the agreement. The application under [ACT] is meant to encourage alternative modes, disputes, resolution i.e. Arbitration, Mediation and Conciliation. Once the bilateral agreement is entered into between the parties and the same provide for arbitration clause then it would be just and appropriate to honour the onerous obligations even though the arbitrator to be appointed by the company from the hierarchy of its officials/employees. The such reference in dispute cannot be said to be harsh or taking away any harsh, oppressive or inequitable, nor the same would be said to be inequitable bargain. Plaintiff was very much conscious about the said clause and thereafter agreement came to be executed. [9]. In [PRECEDENT], the Hon'ble Apex Court while interpreting under [SECTION] and [SECTION] of the [ACT], held that once the agreement and existence of arbitration clause are admitted then as per mandatory language of [SECTION] of the Act, the Court is bound to refer the dispute to the Arbitrator. The question 7 of 10 whether that arbitration clause applied to the facts of the dispute, has to be raised and decided before the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator is competent and has the jurisdiction to adjudicate upon and decide upon his jurisdiction and validity and existence of arbitration agreement with reference to arbitrability of the subject matter of dispute under arbitration clause. Once the existence of agreement between the parties is found containing arbitration clause, the jurisdiction of the civil Court in such matter is barred."

The remedy of the aggrieved party is to raise a objection before the arbitral Tribunal. As provided under [SECTION] of the Act, it is empowered to rule about its own jurisdiction. It is, therefore, open to the plaintiff to raise all these issues and pleas before the arbitral Tribunal, including a plea that there is no arbitration agreement between the parties for referring the dispute for arbitration. In nutshell, the 'Act' itself is a complete code and provides for all channels of adjudication. In [PRECEDENT], it was held that the Legislature in [SECTION] made it clear that any objection with regard to objection or validity of arbitration agreement has to be treated as an agreement independent of other terms of the contract. [12]. Having taken note of the rival contentions of both sides, I am of the view that as per clauses of agreement, more particularly in terms of arbitration clause 33 of the agreement, the issue is legally required to be demonstrated before the Arbitrator and the reference to this effect has to be made under [SECTION] of the Act.

It can, therefore, be said that the movie has unique capacity to disturb and arouse feelings. It has as much potential for evil as it has for good. It has an equal potential to instill or cultivate violent or good behaviour. With the sequalities and since it caters for mass audience who are generally not selective about what they watch, the movie cannot be equated with other modes of communication.

The subject matter of the dispute viz. the termination of the agreement having been conveyed in Bangalore, it was plain that the substantial part of the cause of action arose in Bangalore.

In other words, it would not be an order passed by a Court without jurisdiction. At the highest, it could be said to be an erroneous order passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction.

The very nature of the objection that [SECTION] permits to be raised will require the Court before which such objection is raised to decide on the competence of another Court.

In our opinion, the provision in [SECTION] has to be construed keeping in view the provisions in [SECTION] which give recognition to party autonomy. Accepting the narrow construction as projected by the learned counsel for the appellants would, in fact, render [SECTION] nugatory. In our view, the legislature has intentionally given jurisdiction to two Courts i.e. the Court which would have jurisdiction where the cause of action is located and the Courts where the arbitration takes place. This was necessary as on many occasions the agreement may provide for a seat of arbitration at a place which would be neutral to both the parties. Therefore, the Courts where the arbitration takes place would be required to exercise supervisory control over the arbitral process. For example, if the arbitration is held in Delhi, where neither of the parties are from Delhi, (Delhi having been chosen as a neutral place as between a party from Mumbai and the other from Kolkata) and the tribunal sitting in Delhi passes an interim order under [SECTION] of the [ACT], the appeal against such an interim order under [SECTION] must lie to the Courts of Delhi being the Courts having supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings and the tribunal.

In the present case, there is no exclusive jurisdiction clause. The parties specified the seat as New Delhi but by doing so, they did not intend to oust the jurisdiction of the Court at Bangalore. While some part of the cause of action, for e.g., the decision of the CCS, may have arisen within the jurisdiction of the Court at Delhi, a substantial part of the cause of action had arisen within the jurisdiction of the City Civil Court at Bangalore. In this context the submission of [ENTITY] that the termination of the agreement was conveyed in Bangalore, the agreement was signed at Bangalore, both parties have their registered offices in Bangalore and therefore the substantial parts of the cause of action arose in Bangalore is well founded. The Court, therefore, rejects the plea of [ENTITY] that Delhi has exclusive jurisdiction only because the seat of arbitration was in Delhi, without anything more."

It was underlined that the testimony of the victim in such cases, though commands great weight but the same, cannot necessarily be universally and mechanically accepted to be free in all circumstances from embellishment and exaggeration. It was ruled that the presumption of absence of consent of the victim, where sexual intercourse by the accused is proved as contemplated in [SECTION] of the [ACT], was extremely restricted in its application compared to the sweep and ambit of the presumption under [SECTION] and [SECTION] of the [ACT]. It was exposited that insofar as the allegation of rape is concerned, the evidence of the prosecutrix must be examined as that of an injured witness whose presence at the spot is probable but it can never be presumed that her statement should always without exception, be taken as gospel truth. The essence of this verdict which has stood the test of time proclaims that though generally the testimony of a victim of rape or non-consensual physical assault ought to be accepted as true and unblemished, it would still be subject to judicial scrutiny lest a casual, routine and automatic acceptance thereof results in unwarranted conviction of the person charged.\""

It is a strong circumstance to indicate that it was not a case of kidnapping or abduction, rather it supports the defence version that the victim was a consenting party. Further P.W.2 victim states that the accused took her to village Dharuali Purawa, which is about 4-5 kos' i.e. above 10 Kms. from her village. In between, they crossed 3-4 villages on a bicycle. She was sitting on the carrier of the bicycle. If it was so and the victim was sitting on the carrier of the bicycle and travelled for 4-5 kos' i.e. about 10 kms, she did not make any attempt either to run away or to make a call to invite the attention of others while she reached village Sidauli at about 5.00 A.M.

            "1. On December 20, 1962, the petitioner and [ENTITY] purchased ac. 454.11 guntas of land in Manmole village, Sangareddy Taluk, Medak District, under a registered sale deed for a total consideration of Rs. 75,000. By the date of their purchased of the said lands, the lands were notified under the notification dated October 17, 1961, for acquisition by the government for the construction on a Heavy Electrical Factory. On February 4, 1964, the Land Acquisition Officer passed an award giving compensation in a sum of Rs. 1,38,794.12. But the petitioner and [ENTITY] were not satisfied with the amount of compensation granted under the award by the Land Acquisition officer and filed a petition before the land Acquisition officer for making a reference of the matter to the civil court under [SECTION] of the [ACT]. The matter was accordingly referred to the civil court. On a reference, the District Judge held enquiry into the claims and enhanced the compensation by passing an award for a sum of Rs. 3,95,020 out of which the petitioner share was R[SECTION],08,739. The ITO treated this amount of R[SECTION],08,739 received by the petitioner towards his share from out of the compensation paid by the government as income from business. The assessee preferred an appeal to the AAC contending that the land purchased by him was agricultural in character and that what was realised was only a surplus over and above the investment and this only resulted in capital accretion and as such the amount of R[SECTION],08,739 could not be taxed as business income.

So, it is evident that it is not a casual purchase of investment but it is an adventure in the nature of trade.

On behalf of the assessee, it was contended that it would be difficult to regard a single or an isolated transaction as an adventure in the nature of trade or business. On behalf of the departmentit was contended before the Tribunal that the lands, which were purchased by the petitioner and [ENTITY], were admittedly after the notification and that the transaction of purchase followed by resale can either be an investment or an adventure in the nature of trade. If it is found not to be an investment, then the transaction would undoubtedly be treated as an adventure in the nature of trade and as the question of investment does not arise in the instant case for the reason that the property was purchased after the notification was issued by the government, the only conclusion that has to be arrived at is that the transaction is an adventure in the nature of trade.

            "7. From the facts narrated above, it is clear that the assessee purchased an extent of ac. 454.11 guntas of land in Manmool village, Sangareddy Taluk Medak District. It is not in dispute that the land was notified under the Gazette Notification dated October 17, 1961, for acquisition for the purpose of construction of heavy electrical factory. The petitioner and [ENTITY] purchased the lands proposed for acquisition for a sum of Rs. 75,000. In fact, the petitioner and [ENTITY] are aware of the notification dated October 17, 1961. When the notification dated October 17, 1961, makes it abundantly clear that the lands, which are the subject-matter of the notification, were proposed for acquisition by the Government, it is clear that the petitioner and [ENTITY] purchased the same not for holding or enjoying the said lands but only to receive the compensation from the Government. As to how much they would receive towards compensation, they are aware of the legal position regarding the rate of compensation, as the law regarding compensation is well settled that it is the market value prevailing as on the date of notification but not on the date of acquisition that should be taken into consideration for fixing the market value. Sale deed about the same time or within reasonably time before the notification in respect of the same land or adjacent land or lands in the near locality should be taken into consideration. Hence, the petitioner knew pretty well that they would not get compensation beyond the rate mentioned in the sale deed under which they themselves purchased the land in question. It that be so, the petitioner and his companion did not purchased the land with the sole intention to make profit. It is, therefore, too much to imagine that the petitioner and [ENTITY] expected even at the time of purchased of the lands that they would receive compensation far and above the sale consideration mentioned in their own sale deed. To say that the assessee and [ENTITY] purchased the lands in question with the sole intention to get compensation far and above what was mentioned in the sale deed is nothing but indulging in conjecture and speculation. Merely because the petitioner and [ENTITY] received compensation in a sum of Rs. 3,95,026, an argument cannot be built up that the petitioner and [ENTITY] purchased the lands in question with the sole intention that they would make profit from out of the transaction. The petitioner and [ENTITY], of course, pursued the legal remedies under [SECTION] of the [ACT]. The District Judge ignoring the rate mentioned in the sale deed under which the petitioner and [ENTITY] purchased the land in question, gave a higher rate of compensation. For that, the assessee cannot be penalised, Merely because the petitioner has received his share of compensation from the court in a sum of R[SECTION],08,739, is the Appellate Tribunal justified to treat the amount of R[SECTION],08,739 liable to tax on the ground that the petitioner got this amount as profit from out of the transaction which is an adventure in the nature of trade ?

            "Court Reasoning",
            "11. Judged from this ruling, it is clear that the petitioner's transaction is one consisting simply of an isolated purchase of land without any intention that it would be resold for any profit as such, as the question of resale does not arise in view of the notification issued by the Government for acquisition of the said land. Further, the land is purchased not to be sold but only to get compensation at the rate of to be fixed by the civil court according to the principles of law which are in vogue. Following the principle laid down by Lord President [ENTITY] in [PRECEDENT], we would like to hold that the purchased of the actionable claim, even it is the treated so, to obtain compensation as per the award of the civil court is not a transaction which is an adventure in the nature of trade. In [PRECEDENT], their Lordships of the Supreme Court considered several transactions which is not come under adventure in the nature of trade and which come under adventure in the nature of trade. In that case, the appellant firm acted as managing agent of a company and purchased for a total consideration of Rs. 8,712-15-6 four contiguous plots of land, adjacent to the place where the mills of the company managed by it were situated. The first purchased was made in October, 1941, in the name of a benamidar covering land measuring about 28 cents and the second and subsequent purchases were made in November, 1941, June, 1942, and November, 1942, respectively. As long as the appellant was in possession of the lands, it made no efforts to cultivate them or erect any superstructure on them but allowed them to remain unutilised except for the rent received from the house which existed on one of the plots. The appellant sold these lands to the company managed by it in two lots in September and November, 1947, for a total consideration of Rs. 52,600. The question was whether a sum of Rs. 43,887 being the excess realised by the appellant by the two sales over its purchased price was assessable to income-tax ?"
        ],
        [
            "Court Reasoning",
            "12. The ITO treated the said amount of Rs. 43,887 as the income of the appellant for the assessment year 1948-49, and assessed it to income-tax under the head \"Business\" on the ground that there was no evidence to show that the appellant had purchased the said lands for agricultural purposes or that it had acquired them as an investment. The ITO also found that the lands were adjacent to Janardana Mills and that the appellant must have purchased them solely with a view to sell them to the said mills with a profit. That is why it had all the elements of a business transaction and was thus an adventure in the nature of trade though the transaction was in the nature of a solitary transaction. Against this order of assessment, the appeal preferred an appeal to the AAC. The appellate authority upheld the contention of the appellant that the amount in question was not assessable as it cannot be held to be income or profit resulting from a profit-making scheme and set aside the order under appeal. Against that order of the AAC, the Department preferred an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal. The Tribunal, agreed with the view taken by the ITO and held that the amount in question was not a capital accretion but a gain made in an adventure in the nature of business in carrying out a scheme of profit-making and was, therefore, taxable. On a reference the High Court also held that the transaction was an adventure in the nature of trade and that the department was justified in taxing the amount. On appeal to the Supreme Court, their Lordship held on the facts that the Appellate Tribunal was right in inferring that the appellant knew that it would be able to sell the lands to the managed company whenever it thought it profitable so to do; that the appellant purchased the four plots of land with the sole intention of selling them to mills at a profit which intention raised a strong presumption in favour of the view taken by the Tribunal and that the High Court was right in holding that the transaction in question was an adventure in the nature of trade. It was further held that the expression \"in the nature of trade\" appearing in the definition of \"business\" in [SECTION] of the [ACT] postulates the existence of certain elements in the adventure which invest it with the character of trade or business; and that would make the question whether a transaction is in the nature of a trade and its decision one of mixed law and fact. Where the question is whether a transaction is in the nature of trade even if the conclusion of the Tribunal about the character of the transaction is treated as a conclusion on a question of fact, in arriving at its final conclusion on facts proved, the Tribunal has undoubtedly and necessarily to address itself to the legal requirements associated with the concept of trade or business. Their Lordships also considered as to what elements are the essential features that would make a transaction an adventure in the nature of trade. Their Lordships further held that if a person invest money in land intending to hold it, enjoys its income for some time, and then sells it at a profit, it would be a clear case of capital accretion and not profit derived from an adventure in the nature of trade. Cases of realisation of investments consisting of purchase and resale, though profitable, are clearly outside the domain of adventure in the nature of trade. In deciding the character of such transaction, several factors are relevant, such as, whether the purchaser was a trader and the purchase of the commodity and its resale were allied to his usual trade or business or incidental to it; the nature and quantity of the commodity purchased and resold; any act subsequent to the purchase to improve the quality of the commodity purchased and thereby make it more readily resaleable; any act prior to the purchase showing a design or purpose; the incidents associated with the purchase & resale; the similarity of the transaction to operations usually associated with trade or business; the repetition of the transaction; and the element of pride of possession. A person may purchase a piece of art hold it for some time and if a profitable offer is received, sell it. During the time that the purchaser had its possession, he may be able to claim pride of possession and aesthetic satisfaction; and if such a claim is upheld, that would be a factor against the transaction being in the nature of trade. The presence of all these relevant factors may help the court to draw an inference that a transaction is in the nature of trade; but it is not a matter of merely counting the number of facts and circumstances pro and con; what is important to consider is their distinctive character. In each case, it is the total effect of relevant factors and circumstances that determines the character of the transaction. In case where the purchase has been made solely and exclusively with the intention to resell at a profit and the purchaser has no intention of holding the property for himself or otherwise enjoying or using it the presence of such an intention is a relevant factor and unless it is offset by the presence of other facts in the nature of trade. Even so, the presumption is not conclusive; and it is conceivable that, on considering all the facts and circumstances in the case, the court may, despite the said initial intention, be inclined to hold that the transaction was not an adventure in the nature of trade. The presumption may be rebutted."

            "13. In [PRECEDENT] , the assessee was carrying on business in iron scrap and hardware and never carried on any business in jute or in pressing jute. At the material time when the purchase of the jute press was made, the appellant had because of abnormal conditions prevailing in the town of the Calcutta closed its business in iron scrap and hardware. The assessee purchased the jute press and the premises appurtenant thereto subject to litigant pending in the High Court, effected certain repairs and kept the factory in running condition, but made to attempt to start or organise the business of pressing jute, and his plea that he was not able to secure labour for working the press was not true. Soon after he bought the factory, the appellant received an offer from [ENTITY] to buy the factory and he immediately accepted the offer to sell it to him. These facts, in the view of the Tribunal, indicated that the appellant purchased the jute press, subject to litigation, with the sole object of reselling at profit at the earliest opportunity and, therefore, the transaction was in the nature of a trading venture. The High Court substantially agreed with his view. The Supreme court had to examine whether the transaction of the assessee is an adventure in the nature of trade. Their Lordship observed that \"it has been consistently held by this court that the question whether profit in a transaction had arisen out of an adventure in the nature of trade is a mixed questioned of fact and law\". It was emphasised from an analysis of the cases that a profit motive in entering into a transaction is not decisive, for an accretion to capital does not become taxable income merely because an asset was acquired in the expectation that it may be sold at profit. Purchase of the property by the appellant was an isolated transaction not related to the business of the appellant. The Tribunal and the High Court were, in our judgment, in error in holding that the rights of the company was not sold to the appellant in the lands of [SECTION] properties. The land in [SECTION] was leasehold, and on it was constructed a warehouse and the land in [SECTION] was held as a licensee and two warehouses were standing thereon. The conveyance by the company to the appellant is not on the record, but the recitals in the deed dated September 30, 1943, definitely indicate that the rights of company without any reservation were purchased by the appellant and the appellant sold its entire rights in the properties in Schedules I, II and III without any reservation. It is true that the appellant had put the factory in a working condition, but had not organised a jute pressing business, had not obtained a licence for working the factory, had not attempted to secure orders for pressing jute, and had not employed labourers. The appellant's claim that it has not so done because the appellant could not secure labourers has not been accepted. But that is not a decisive circumstances. The factory was in the occupation of the lessee, [ENTITY] and possession was obtained after August 10, 1943, But before August 10, an agreement of sale was executed by the appellant in favour of [ENTITY]. In the light of the sequence of events, the inference that the appellant had no intention to commence doing jute pressing business does not necessarily follow. Even if that inference be regarded as binding upon the court, it cannot be presumed that the sole intention of the appellant was to start a venture in the nature of trade. Barring the expectation of profit and realisation of profit by sale of the property, there is no evidence bearing on the intention with which the property was purchased."

Thus it is clear that their Lordships of the Supreme Court in [PRECEDENT] , made it abundantly clear that where the purchase has been made solely and exclusively with the intention to resell it at a profit and the purchaser has no intention to hold it for himself or to enjoy it or to use it, the transaction is an adventure in the nature of trade."

It was purchased, of course with the intention to receive compensation, by the civil court ultimately under an award fixing the compensation according to the principles established by law. It is the exclusive jurisdiction of the civil court as to how much it has to pay by way of compensation in view of the law governing the matter.

While holding so, the learned judges further added that profit-making would normally not be an irrelevant consideration for every honest and prudent purchaser but will not in every case make the purchase a venture in the nature of trade and to bring a transaction within this category, it has to be shown that the sole intention as the time of purchase was to sell the property purchased later on at a profit and the burden is upon the department to show that a transaction effected by the assessee is an adventure in the nature of trade."

As to how much compensation he would get was not in the hands. It is the civil court that has to pass ultimately an award and the award will have to be passed in accordance with the established law. He got the higher compensation as a casual and non-recurring receipt. His getting higher compensation as a result of the award by the civil court cannot make the purchase a venture in the nature of trade."

Thereafter, he purchased some houses property from the judgment-debtor for a consideration of R[SECTION]1,500 and adjusted the sum of Rs. 8,000 due under the decree in part payment of consideration. The ITO assessed the profit of Rs. 4,000 made by the assessee in the transaction relating to the assessment of the decree as business profit. This was confirmed by the AAC. On a reference by the Tribunal at the instance of the assessee, the High Court held that when the assessee purchased the decree on payment of Rs. 4,000 he should have intended to executing the decree and realise the amount the thereunder and the fact that without the necessity of executing the decree, the assessee was able to realise the money by adjustment in the purchase consideration made no different. Accordingly, the sum of Rs. 4,000 was rightly assessable as business profit. The absence of any prior or subsequent dealing in purchase and sale of decrees by the assessee had no significant because even a first venture could be an adventure in the nature of trade."

The outstandings and liabilities of the concerns were not transferred to the company. In 1957, two claims of the concerns were purchased by the company for an aggregate amount of Rs. 57,716. In the accounting year 1958-59, there was an award in regard to one of the claims under which the assessee received a sum of money. The surplus realised over cost amounting to Rs. 60,940 was brought to tax as income from business by the Income-tax Officer. The Tribunal reversed the decision of the ITO on the ground that the memorandum of association of the assessee-company did not permit it to trade in actionable claims. The Bombay High Court held that the fact that the memorandum of association did not permit the assessee-company to trade in actionable claims was irrelevant. At the time of purchasing the actionable claims, the assessee was under no obligation or compulsion to do so. In point of time, there was close proximity between the purchase of the claims and the realisation. The assessee had embarked upon a venture in the nature of trade and the surplus realised from the venture was liable to be included in the income of the assessee under [SECTION]."

They were rendered with reference to the facts and circumstances of those cases. In those cases, the transactions were clearly and solely intended to make profit and hence the profits were assessable to income-tax.

Difference in some minor detail, which does not otherwise affect the core of the prosecution case, even if present, would not itself prompt the court to reject the evidence on minor variations and discrepancies.

Thus, an undue importance should not be attached to omissions, contradictions and discrepancies which do not go the heart of the matter and shake the basic version of prosecution witness. As the mental capabilities of a human being cannot be expected to be attuned to absorb all the details, minor discrepancies are bound to occur in statements of witnesses.\" In view of this judgment, it stands proved that only those contradictions are material which are going into the root of dispute and render the incident doubtful but contradictions with regard to the transportation of seized articles at the instance of accused to PS or some contradiction with [CASE NUMBER] [ENTITY]Vs.[ENTITY] 26/31 regard to availability of public witnesses or non joining of public witnesses during investigation are not material and this plea is hereby rejected."

However, the plea of the Ld. counsel for the accused that accused cannot be made liable for habitual offence of a particular set of offence is sustainable, if the accused has already been convicted. In this case also, accused has been convicted u/[SECTION] [ACT] on similar facts and has been declared habitual offender and now he cannot be convicted again to be an habitual offender on the basis of similar facts. However, he can be definitely tried and convicted for the offence of receiving of another stolen property which was the subject matter of other offence registered got by the PW3."

This testimony of the PWs is un-rebutted in the absence of cross examination by the accused. This fact itself suggests that the motorcycle was stolen and was in possession of someone else prior to purchasing the same by accused from third persons. As such, second ingredients of the judgment also stands proved. Lastly, the knowledge of the accused regarding stolen articles also stands proved by the recovery of a huge quantity of the motorcycles and spare parts. A person in possession of huge quantity of stolen articles cannot be in possession of such articles without his knowledge. All the articles possessed by the PW6 and other team members, in pursuance of disclosure statement of the accused, were seized u/[SECTION] [ACT] and it was the duty of the accused to explain as to how he came into possession of such huge quantity of the stolen articles and, in the absence of such explanation, it stands proved accused was in conscious possession of stolen articles and he is liable for the same.

A three Judge Bench decision of the Supreme Court in [PRECEDENT] while overruling the judgment in [PRECEDENT] that the provisions of the [ACT] prior to its amendment in 1994 included liability in respect of every person travelling in a goods vehicle ruled that after the amendment to [SECTION] of the [ACT] w.e.f. 1994 (by virtue of [SECTION] of Act of 1994) it was compulsory for the insurer to insure the risk of the owner of the goods or his authorized representative being carried in a goods vehicle."

In the instant case, as stated earlier, the Insurance Company has preferred not to challenge the award of compensation in three injury cases.

Sesh Reddy, (1996) 5 SCC 21. As per [SECTION] of the [ACT] (the Act), an insurer is entitled to defend the action on the grounds as mentioned under [SECTION] of the Act. Thus, the onus is on the insurer to prove that there is breach of the condition of the policy. It is well settled that the breach must be conscious and willful. Even if a conscious breach on the part of the insured is established, still the insurer has a statutory liability to pay the compensation to the third party and will simply have the right to recover the same from the insured/tortfeasor either in the same proceedings or by independent proceedings as the case may be, as ordered by the Claims Tribunal or the Court. The question of statutory liability to pay the compensation was discussed in detail by a two Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in [ENTITY] Insurance Company Limited v. Kokilaben Chandravadan, (1987) 2 SCC 654 where it was held that exclusion clause in the contract of Insurance must be read down being in conflict with the main statutory provision enacted for protection of victim of accidents. It was laid down that the victim would be entitled to recover the compensation from the insurer irrespective of the breach of the condition of policy. The three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in [ENTITY] analyzed the corresponding provisions under the [ACT] and the [ACT] and approved the decision in [ENTITY]. In New India Assurance Co., Shimla v. [ENTITY] and Ors., (2001) 4 SCC 342, the Supreme Court referred to the decision of the two Judge Bench in [ENTITY], the three Judge Bench decision in [ENTITY] and held that the insurer who has been made liable to pay the compensation to third parties on account of issuance of certificate of insurance, shall be entitled to recover the same if there was any breach of the policy condition on account of the vehicle being driven without a valid driving licence.

Learned Judge pointed out that the insistence of the legislature that a motor vehicle can be used in a public place only if that vehicle is covered by a policy of insurance is not for the purpose of promoting the business of the insurance company but to protect the members of the community who become suffers on account of accidents arising from the use of motor vehicles. It is pointed out in the decision that such protection would have remained only a paper protection if the compensation awarded by the courts were not recoverable by the victims (or dependants of the victims) of the accident.

Acting on this information, police party headed by him went in a mini bus make Swaraj Mazda (for short, mini bus) and on seeing the police party both the accused tried to slip away but were apprehended. They disclosed their names as [ENTITY] and [ENTITY]. After usual formalities of introduction, the Investigating Officer expressed his suspicion and his intention to search accused and after explaining accused of their rights under law sought their option of being searched. Both the accused showed their desire to be searched in the presence of Gazetted Officer regarding which consent memos Ex.PA and Ex.PA/1 were prepared. As per this option PW3 [ENTITY], DSP (now Retd.) was called, who after arriving at the spot disclosed his identity and apprised accused of their rights of search on the basis of which accused [ENTITY] and [ENTITY] gave their consent by way of memos Ex.PB and Ex.PB/1. All these memos were attested by the witnesses and signed by accused. As per this option of search in the presence of the DSP, Investigating Officer searched accused [ENTITY] and from the bag of brown colour being held by him in his right hand, heroin wrapped in a cloth piece with seal affixed carrying inscription in Urdu and [CASE NUMBER] and [CASE NUMBER] -3- emblem of 'Star' and '777' scribed on the seal was recovered. 5 grams of heroin was drawn as sample and remaining 495 grams of residual Ex.P1 was prepared into separate parcel and both these parcels were sealed with the seals HS and MS of Investigating Officer. Separate sample seal impressions were also prepared. Similarly, from the search of accused [ENTITY] from the black colour bag held by him heroin wrapped in polythene carrying a sticker of 'Manisha' was recovered which also bore triangular seal blue in colour with inscription in Urdu bearing emblem of 'Star' and '777'. 5 grams of heroin was drawn as sample and remaining 495 grams of residual Ex.P2 was prepared into separate parcel and both the parcels were sealed with the same very seals and separate seal impressions were prepared.

The argument has been refuted on behalf of State that firstly recovery has been effected from a public place and that too in the presence of Gazetted Officer does not calls for such a requirement. Appreciating these submissions the very wording of [SECTION] and [SECTION] of the Act makes it sufficiently clear that [SECTION] is applicable in cases of recovery as a consequence of search of a building, conveyance and enclosed place, whereas, [SECTION] deals with arrest and seizure in any public place while narcotic is under transit. It needs to be emphasised here that as an explanation to [SECTION] the expression 'public place' includes any public conveyance, hotel, shop or other place intended for use by or accessible to the public. In this case the plain reading of testimonies of PW1 [ENTITY] and PW3 [ENTITY], DSP (Retd.) make it sufficiently clear that after the receipt of secret information, accused were apprehended while standing near Gill Farm, a marriage palace on the G.T. Road, Jalandhar, thus, by all means a public place.

Prosecution should be ordered when it is considered expedient in the interests of justice to punish the delinquent and not merely because there is some inaccuracy in the statement which may be innocent or immaterial.

        [
            "Precedent",
            "1[SECTION]. That leaves for our consideration the alleged offence under [SECTION]. [SECTION] provides punishment for making a false statement in a declaration which is by law receivable in evidence. We will assume that the affidavits filed in a proceeding for allotment of premises before the Rent Control Officer are receivable as evidence. It is complained that certain averments in these affidavits are false though no specific averment is singled out for this purpose in the complaint. When it is alleged that a false statement has been made in a declaration which is receivable as evidence in any Court of Justice or before any public servant or other person, the statement alleged to be false has to be set out and its alleged falsity with reference to the truth found in some document has to be referred to pointing out that the two situations cannot co-exist, both being attributable to the same person and, therefore, one to his knowledge must be false. Rival contentions set out in affidavits accepted or rejected by courts with reference to onus probandi do not furnish foundation for a charge under [SECTION], [ACT] To illustrate the point, appellant 1 [ENTITY] alleged that he was in possession of one room forming part of premises No. 385/2. The learned Additional District Judge after scrutinising all rival affidavits did not accept this contention. It thereby does not become false. The only inference is that the statement made by [ENTITY] did not inspire confidence looking to other relevant evidence in the case. Acceptance or rejection of evidence by itself is not a sufficient yardstick to dub the one rejected as false. Falsity can be alleged when truth stands out glaringly and to the knowledge of the person who is making the false statement. Day in and day out, in courts averments made by one set of witnesses are accepted and the counter averments are rejected. If in all such cases complaints under [SECTION], [ACT] are to be filed not only there will open up floodgates of litigation but it would unquestionably be an abuse of the process of the Court. The learned Counsel for the respondents told us that a tendency to perjure is very much on the increase and unless by firm action courts do not put their foot down heavily upon such persons the whole judicial process would come to ridicule. We see some force in the submission but it is equally true that chagrined and frustrated litigants should not be permitted to give vent to their frustration by cheaply invoking jurisdiction of the criminal court. Complainant herein is an Advocate. He lost in both courts in the rent control proceedings and has now rushed to the criminal court. This itself speaks volumes. Add to this the fact that another suit between the parties was pending from 1975. The conclusion is inescapable that invoking the jurisdiction of the criminal court in this background is an abuse of the process of law and the High Court rather glossed over this important fact while declining to exercise its power under [SECTION], [ACT]"

In the facts of the present case, it is clear that the statement made in the anticipatory bail application cannot be tested against unimpeachable evidence as evidence has not yet been led. Moreover, the report dated 12.11.2011 being a report, which is in the nature of a preliminary investigation report by the investigating officer filed only two days after the F.I.R. is lodged, can in no circumstances be regarded as unimpeachable evidence contrary to the statements that have been made in the anticipatory bail application. Further, as has been correctly pointed out by learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, that though the submission recorded by the High Court in para 3 of the order dated 30.11.2017 is from the aforesaid paragraph in the anticipatory bail application, yet, the High court made it clear that it was granting anticipatory bail principally because the F.I.R. annexed to the bail application does not show that there was sexual intercourse of the applicant with his wife during the course of their separation as a result of which it was not possible to assess whether the averment regarding the offence punishable under [SECTION] of the [ACT] is or is not substantiated. The High Court also recorded that considering that the husband and wife had resided together after marriage only for a very brief period, and that the husband was granted interim anticipatory bail, decided to grant final anticipatory bail on these grounds. It is clear, therefore, that both the grounds stated by the High Court would not suffice to initiate prosecution under [SECTION] read with [SECTION] of the [ACT]"

The Committee gathered facts in great detail, as is mentioned in paras 8 & 9 of the aforesaid judgment, and ultimately came to certain conclusions after a detailed enquiry. It is in this circumstance that this Court found, after perusing the Committees Report, that the College in question had manufactured records brazenly in order to obtain favourable orders from the Court.

As has been stated in the facts of the present case, the High Court has not scrutinised any evidence as there was none to scrutinise. Further, all that the High Court has seen is a preliminary investigation report, and that too by a police officer, together with a High Court order granting anticipatory bail, none of which can be said to be unimpeachable evidence against which it can clearly be stated that a prima facie case of perjury can be said to have been made out. This judgment also does not further the respondents case. The respondent then relied upon Perumal vs. Janaki, (201[SECTION]) 5 SCC [SECTION] and para 20, in particular, to state that the High Courts not only have the authority to exercise such jurisdiction under [SECTION] but also an obligation to exercise such power in appropriate cases.

The Government calls for the papers for the purpose of\"satisfying itself as to the legality or propriety of such order or as to the regularity of such procedure\". Even where the lower authority and particularly the competent authority under the Act do not follow the proper procedure, the revisional powers can be exercised by the Government. If the construction canvassed by the counsel for tile petitioners is accepted. the phrase\" proceedings taken under the provisions of this Act\" will become redundant inasmuch has if the argument is accepted the Government will have power only, in cases where the appeal is provided and the same is not preferred. This Would amount to rendering the said phrase redundant. This cannot be done for the simple reason that the Legislature does not use a single word without purpose. Tile [SECTION] of the Act requires that a person who may be affected be given an opportunity of being heard. A person likely to be affected would be one in whose favour the order has been passed by the lower authority. Since the Government may not have preferred any appeal against such an order the order would have become final in his favour. The proviso requires that when the Government takes the matter in suo motu revision. such a person who is likely to be affected should be afforded an opportunity of being, heard.

In that case the revisional powers were sought to be exercised after a period of about one year and therefore it was considered to be too late, Therefore, contends the counsel for the petitioners looking at the provisions of the Act. an appeal is provided against the order passed under [SECTION] of the Act to the High Court as provided under [SECTION] of the Act; such appeal should be filled within 90 days. There are other two provisions in the Act which provide for appeal, They are [SECTION] and [SECTION]. Therein the period of limitation for filing appeal is [SECTION] days On this basis it is submitted that the reasonable period for exercising the revisional jurisdiction by the Government under the provisions of [SECTION] of the Act should he considered to be at the most one year from the date of the order sought to be taken in revision under [SECTION] of the Act."

If the application is not decided within a prescribed time limit. i.e three months, the Collector shall be deemed to have granted the permission Sought for. Section also provides that whenever the land is put to use for a purpose unconnected with agriculture, the Collector may himself impose it fine upon the occupant of the land. Thus it is clear that the section deals with the rights of an individual to put his land to a particular use. There is a statutory embargo upon the user of the land .The land cannot be used for any other purpose except for agricultural purpose, unless the permission of the Collector is obtained This embargo is removed if the office of the Collector does not take decision within a period of three months from the date of receipt of the application seeking permission to put the land for any other use.

The assessee preferred appeal before the Assistant Collector of Sales Tax who decided the appeal on Oct 29, 1956 and accepted the claim of the assessee in respect of the dispatches to its various Depots or Branches in other States in India. However, the appellate authority disallowed the balance of the claim. This order was sought to be taken in revision by the Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax by his notice dated January 7, 1963. Thus after a period of about seven years, the proceedings were sought to be taken in revision by the authority on whom the powers were conferred In such a factual situation, it was contended that it should be held that the proceedings sought to be instituted are barred by time because limitation of a reasonable time within which the revisional powers are to be exercised must be implied in the statute itself, In para 8 of the judgment the Supreme Court while referring to an earlier decision has observed that the only limitation to which that power can be subjected is that\" the revising authority should not trench upon the powers which are expressly reserved by the Acts or by the Rules to other authority and should not ignore limitation inherent in the exercise of those powers\".

Just as in [ENTITY]'s case ([PRECEDENT]) (supra), the Supreme Court refused to read any period of limitation, it is possible to say that having regard to the Scheme and the object of the Act, no period of limitation can be read in [SECTION] of the Act. It may be noted that the Government exercises its power under [SECTION]. The Government seeks to fulfill its obligation towards society. The State or the Government is not an interested party to take excess land from the individual. The interest of the Government is to see that the objects of the Act, namely, the prevention of concentration of urban land in few hands and prevention of speculation and profiteering in the land, be achieved so that the land is equitably distributed to all. The Government cannot be absolved from its obligation towards society because some officers of the Government are negligent and/or indolent and do not take action in time. In such cases the principle underlying [SECTION] of the [ACT] can very well be applied. [SECTION] of the [ACT] grants a total exemption from the bar of limitation in regard to the suits mentioned therein. The reason behind the section is that an express trust ought not to suffer by the misfeasance or non?feasance of a trustee. Similarly, it may be stated that on account of the negligence or, complacent behaviour of a Government officer, the society should not be made to suffer. The land which otherwise would have vested in the Government as per the provisions of the Act should not be allowed to be used by an individual on account of technical pleas of limitation.

But it is clear that there was a mistake, a mistake common to both i.e. the competent authority as well as the petitioners. Both of them proceeded on the footing that the holding of land is to be considered in respect of each partner of the firm and not in respect of the firm treating the firm as a unit. Now the mistake has been discovered. Therefore the proceedings by way of suo motu revision have been started. This is the reason specified in the notice.

The basis of their claim as stated in that suit is that during the lifetime of late [ENTITY] whom they claimed was the Karta of their Joint Hindu family under Mitak-shara Hindu law jointly shared and enjoyed the suit property and all the benefits which accrued there to. But to their shock and surprise they came to know that the suit property had been sold by the petitioners in this case (defendant No.2 & 5 in the suit) by a sale deed dated 30.05.[SECTION]13. Therefore, they filed a Civil Suit for declaration of their title over 1/7th of the suit property and cancellation of the sale deed, and the name of the petitioners from the patta of Suit property. After the suit was instituted the petitioner here in filed the Civil Misc No. 19/[SECTION]15 under [SECTION] read with [SECTION] of [ACT] praying for rejection or dismissal of the plaint in the [CASE NUMBER] by contending as follows:"

During the lifetime of late [ENTITY] a plot of land (the suit land) was purchased by both petitioner No.1 and late [ENTITY] on [SECTION].04.1971 from one [ENTITY] and a sale deed was executed wherein the petitioner No.1 was the only signatory in the sale deed. In course of time, the land was developed and 4 storeyed RCC building was constructed in which a hotel namely Apna Hotel was started and is still being run. The land was mutated in the name of petitioner No.1 and on 10/08/1976 the Jamabandi was issued in her name. Late [ENTITY] also had another wife to whom he was first married i.e. the profoma respondent No.4 and the other respondents are his legal heirs through that marriage. During his lifetime, late. [ENTITY] handed over all his properties situated at Diphu, Bongaigaon and Delhi to the profoma respondent No.4 and the legal heirs through her. But the suit land and the building continued to be the property of the petitioner No.1 as she was the absolute owner free from all incomprehension. However, in the year 1999, the respondent No.1 (opposite party No.1 in the Civil Misc Case No. 19/[SECTION]15) along with her mother that is profoma respondent No.4 requested the petitioner No.1 to allow them to run the Apna Hotel on rental basis. Considering their request the petitioner No.1 allowed them to run the Hotel at nominal monthly rent of Rs 10,000/-, which was regularly paid till the Hotel was disposed off on 30.05.[SECTION]13. The petitioner's case in the Civil Misc Case was that the plaintiffs in the Civil Suit No.3/[SECTION]15 who are none other than the opposite parties in that Civil Misc Case No.19/[SECTION]15 has no case to go for trial in view of the facts and circumstances stated above, therefore, the suit ought to be dismissed at the threshold."

            "Precedent",
            "\"39. We are of the view that the respondents are right in contending that enforcement of the negative covenants presupposes the existence of a subsisting agreement. As noticed earlier, the law is well settled that the renewal of an agreement or lease requires execution of a document in accordance with law evidencing the renewal. The grant of renewal is also a fresh grant. In the instant case, the appellant-plaintiff did exercise their option and claim renewal. The respondents denied their right to claim renewal in express terms and also unequivocally stated that the agreement did not stand renewed as contended by the appellants. Having regard to these facts it must be held that a cause of action accrued to the appellant-plaintiff when their right of renewal was denied by the respondents. This happen in December [SECTION]01 and, therefore, within three years from that date they ought to have taken appropriate proceedings to get their right of renewal declared and enforced by a court of law and/or to get a declaration that the agreement stood renewed for a further period of 5 years upon the appellants' exercising their option to claim renewal under the original agreement . The appellant- plaintiffs have failed to do so. However, the plaint proceeds on the assumption that the original agreement stood renewed including the negative covenants contained in [SECTION] and [SECTION] of the original agreement which authorised only the appellants to extract ore from the mine with an obligation cast on the respondent-defendants not to interfere with the enjoyment of their rights under the agreement. In the facts of this case, in the suit prayer for injunction based on negative covenants could not be asked for unless it was first established that the agreement continued to subsist. The use of the words \"during the subsistence of this agreement\" in clause 15, and \"during the pendency of this indenture\" in clause [SECTION] of the agreement is significant. In the absence of a document renewing the original agreement for a further period of 5 years and in the absence of any declaration from a court of law that the original agreement stood renewed automatically upon the appellants, exercising their option for grant of renewal, as is the case of the appellants, they cannot be granted relief of injunction, as prayed for in the suit, for the simple reason that there is no subsisting agreement evidenced by a written document or declared by a court. If there is no such agreement, there is no question of enforcing [SECTION] and [SECTION] thereof. The appellants ought to have prayed for a declaration that their agreement stood renewed automatically on exercise of option for renewal and only on that basis could they have sought an injunction restraining the respondents from interfering with their possession and operation. Having not done so, they cannot be permitted to camouflage the real issue and claim an order of injunction without establishing the subsistence of a valid agreement. In the instant suit as well they could have sought a declaration that the agreement stood renewed automatically but such a claim would have been barred by limitation since more than 3 years had elapsed after a categoric denial of their right claiming renewal or automatic renewal by the respondent-defendants."

Mr. [ENTITY] contended that this case was governed not by [SECTION] of the [ACT] but, if at all, by [SECTION] thereof because there is no specific article provided for enforcement of positive or negative covenants. We shall assume that he is right in contending that [SECTION] may apply where enforcement of a positive or negative covenant is sought in a suit for injunction. However, in this case we have found that the real foundation for the suit was that the earlier agreement stood renewed automatically containing the same terms and conditions as in the original agreement including the negative covenants. There is neither a documents to prove that the agreement stood renewed nor is there a declaration by a court that the agreement stood renewed automatically on exercise of option for renewal by the appellants. The basis for claiming the relief of injunction, namely, a subsisting renewed agreement did not exist in fact. In its absence, no relief as prayed for in the suit could be granted by the clever device of filing a suit for injunction, without claiming a declaration as to their subsisting rights under a renewed agreement, which is apparently barred by limitation."

In the facts and circumstances of the case and on the basis of the evidence brought on record, I am of the considered view that complainant has failed to prove its case against accused no. 1 also beyond reasonable doubt because of the following reasons : I.

During examination of complainant by this court and by ExCW1/Y (colly), it has already come on record that complainant had resigned from the Directorship of company on 23/05/2007.

Admittedly, no independent public witness has been joined in the investigation. Only police personnel are witnesses to the recovery, however, the said fact itself cannot be the sole ground for discarding their testimony. Statutory desirability in the matter of search and seizure is that there should be support from unbiased and neutral corner. The search before an independent witness imparts much more authenticity and credit worthiness to the search and seizure proceedings. Such safeguard is intended to avoid criticism of arbitrary and highhanded action against police officers. This is to lend credibility to the procedure relating to search and seizure. Indubitably, if the evidence of the official witnesses is found to be credible and coherent, same can alone prove to be foundation for conviction and normally, prosecution case cannot be thrown away straightaway merely because chief plank of evidence is that of official witnesses. However, it puts the Court on guard and the testimony of such official witnesses is, in such a situation, liable to be scrutinized with extra caution. Simultaneously, prosecution has to offer satisfactory explanation for not associating independent witnesses. In such a situation, courts are fully justified in finding out the reasons as to why no such person came forward and whether the investigating agency did its best to persuade independent persons."

I am of the considered opinion that testimony of these witnesses cannot be brushed aside merely because no public persons have been joined in investigation. The provisions as provided under [SECTION] [ACT] are only directory and failure to comply with the said provisions will not invariably be fatal for the case of the prosecution.

[ENTITY] of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1956 SC 411, it is held that irregularity cannot vitiate the trial unless the accused has been prejudiced by the defect and it is also held that if reliable local witnesses are not available the search would not be vitiated. In [ENTITY] of Maharashtra v. P.K. Pathak, AIR SC 1224, it is held that absence of any independent person from the locality to witness the search does not affect the trial and the conviction of the accused under the [ACT]. In Radha Kishan v. [ENTITY] of Uttar Pradesh, 1963 SC 822, it is held that irregularity in a search would, however, cast a duty upon the Court to scrutinise the evidence regarding the search very carefully. In [PRECEDENT] it is held that when the salutary provisions have not been complied with, it may, however, affect the weight of the evidence in support of the search or may furnish a reason for disbelieving the evidence produced by the prosecution unless the prosecution properly explains such circumstance which made it impossible for it to comply with these provisions"

On 5.12.1980, the petitioner was alleged to be in charge of vehicle No. GRE 7938 meant for official tour of Pipeline Engineers. When he was asked by the officer to drive the vehicle to a doctor, since the officer was having headache and bodyache, the petitioner refused to drive and, when the other officer sought to drive the vehicle, the petitioner laid himself down in front of the vehicle and abused his superior officer. When the petitioner was, upon his refusal to drive the vehicle, asked to report to his headquarter on the next day, he did not comply and again laid himself down before the vehicle preventing the officers from moving to the site for performing their official duties. Out of these basic and broad facts, there undisputably was sufficient evidence to prove the incident of 5.12.1980. It was submitted that the alleged incident of 6.12.1980 was not proved. Examining these arguments and going through the elaborate discussion of the evidence in the impugned award as also the enquiry report, it was found that more than one witness had deposed in support of the allegation and the depositions had withstood the cross-examination. The only discrepancy in the evidence regarding the incident of 5.12.1980 was that the officers had intended to go to a movie and not to the doctor as alleged. As regards the incident of 6.12.1980, it was vehemently contended that the enquiry officer had mainly relied upon the deposition of the officer who was the complainant and the proof of innocence of the petitioner not being convincing."

And as for the incident of 6.12.1980, the reliance by the Enquiry Officer on the lack of convincing proof of innocence was canvassed as revelation of the biased mind of the Enquiry Officer. It was submitted that in all likelihood the petitioner was belabouring under a serious misconception about the rules of custody of vehicle and under an impression that he might be responsible for any accident that might be committed by any other person driving the vehicle in his charge, he could have tried to prevent the vehicle from being driven by anyone else.

After the petition being filed in April 1991, after six years of the proceedings in the Labour Court, when the petition was admitted and Rule was made returnable on 18.11.1991, even the notice of Rule was not served till 18.11.1992. According to the order dated 21.3.2000, the notice issued to the respondents had not yet been received back and, therefore, fresh notice was ordered to be issued. The other important aspect is that the factual controversies were sought to be raised and discrepancies or insufficiency of evidence were sought to be pointed out and amplified on behalf of the petitioner on the basis of selected pieces of evidence that were annexed and, therefore, it was vehemently opposed on the ground that the finding of facts were recorded after taking a comprehensive view of the totality of evidence on record.

In the facts of the present case, it is seen that the acts of insubordination and causing damage to work in progress by preventing movement of the vehicle even by other person are held to have been proved on the basis of cogent evidence and are practically admitted by the petitioner. The contention of the order to drive on 5.12.1980 being at a time when the duty hours were over appears to have been raised for the first time. And even assuming that the order to drive the officers to a clinic or to a theatre was not lawful and reasonable, the admitted act of preventing the vehicle from plying by anyone else clearly indicates a defiant and unruly behaviour on the part of the petitioner. It would be hazardous for the Court, and for that matter for any third party, to fix a standard of behaviour which can be tolerated in case of a driver in view of the peculiar kind of duties that a driver has to perform and the confidence and rapport that he must enjoy. The proved misconduct of the driver would be the most relevant aspect in considering whether the Labour Court ought to have exercised its powers under [SECTION] of the Act. [SECTION] of the [ACT] empowers the Labour Court to set aside the order of discharge or dismissal and direct reinstatement of the workman on such terms and conditions as it may think fit as also to award lesser punishment on condition of it being satisfied that the order of discharge or dismissal was not justified. It, therefore, follows that if the Court is satisfied that dismissal was justified in a given case, it lacks the jurisdiction to interfere with the order of punishment. In the facts of the present case, the satisfaction of the Labour Court about the dismissal being justified is reached on the basis of cogent reasoning and recorded in no uncertain terms. The punishment of dismissal is also not found to be too harsh in the facts and circumstances of the case.

The assessees concerned in these two references are joint managing directors of Messrs. Eastern Tea Estates (P.) Ltd., a private limited company, incorporated under the [ACT], hereinafter referred to as the Company. Their powers and duties are set out in [SECTION], [SECTION], [SECTION], [SECTION], [SECTION] and [SECTION] of the articles of association of the company. It may be seen from [SECTION] of the above articles that the joint managing directors of the company are to hold office on a monthly remuneration of Rs. 1,000 each and 5 per cent commission on sales besides actual travelling expenses, etc., incurred inconnection with the business. It is also provided in this article that they would hold office till their death but would have the option to resign by giving notice in writing. The two assessees who are the joint managing directors of the company submitted their income-tax returns for the assessment years 1955-[SECTION], 19[SECTION]-57 and 1957-58 covering respectively the calendar years 1954, 1955 and 19[SECTION], respectively. During the calendar year 1953 and assessment year 1954-55, the assesses in addition to their remuneration of Rs. 1,000 per month in each case had also received some amount towards commission and in the return for that year they showed the receipt of both these items. The assessees were assessed on the basis of their return, that is on the basis of what was actually received by way of commission in addition to the monthly remuneration of Rs. 1,000 in each case. Hence the assessment, it is claimed, was done on the basis of business income. Similarly, the assessments for the assessment years 1955-[SECTION] and 19[SECTION]-57 were also completed, on the basis of the returns filed by the assessees, on March 28, 1957. But in the returns for these two assessments years only the remuneration of Rs. 1,000 per month was included and no amount was shown as commission receipts, in view of the fact that the assessees did not actually receive any amount towards the commission. it is also the case of the assessees, in this connection, that while the company followed the mercantile system of accounting, the assessees followed the cash system, reckoning as income only amounts that had been actually received into their hands, and since no amount towards commission had been received during the assessment years in question, namely, 1955-[SECTION] and 19[SECTION]-57, that is the calendar years 1954 and 1955, respectively, the returns did not show any commission, the same having not been actually received. The assessment for all the three assessment years, as indicated above, was completed on March 28, 1957, and the assessees were assessed on the basis of their returns for all these years."

            "Subsequently, the assessment of the company was completed on February 25, 19[SECTION]. The scrutiny of the accounts of the company revealed that the two sums of Rs. 73,996 and Rs. 91,589 had been debited in the books of the company and the two sums of Rs. 36,998 and Rs. 45,695 were in each case credited in the personal accounts of the assesses as commission calculated at 5 per cent, on the sales, during the respective calendar years, namely, 1954 and 1955. From a note, appearing at page 51 of the printed paper-book, in the assessment order made by the Income-tax Officer against the company for the year of assessment 1955-[SECTION], it appears that the joint managing directors, that is, the assessees herein, had not shown receipt of any income by way of commission in the returns filed by them for the calendar years 1954 and 1955. Subsequent to the completion of the assessment of the companys income on February 25, 19[SECTION], notices were served on the assessees on March 19, 19[SECTION], under [SECTION] of the [ACT], hereinafter referred to as the Act, in regard to the assessment years 1955-[SECTION] and 19[SECTION]-57 and on the basis of those notices the 5 per cent. commission that was debited in the companys accounts as payable to the joint managing directors was respectively added to their remuneration of Rs. 1,000 per month, in respect of which the assessees had already submitted their returns, and acting under [SECTION] of the Act, the Income-tax Office made the impugned reassessments. The assessees contended that their income of Rs. 1,000 per month was only a remuneration and represented a business income and not a salary, that, therefore, they could only be assessed under [SECTION] of the act and not under [SECTION]; that the 5 per cent. commission which had not, in fact been received by them, could not have been included in the returns as it did not represent moneys that had been received, and the returns submitted by them originally were correct and proper, and that there was no omission or failure on the part of the assessees to disclose any of the material facts necessary for enabling the Income-tax Officer to make a correct assessment, and that, therefore, no action could have been taken under [SECTION] of the Act and that the notices issued under [SECTION] are not valid and thus the assessees are not liable for any reassessment under that section.

Secondly, in regard to the assessment years 1955-[SECTION] and 19[SECTION]-57, [SECTION] could not at all have been invoked as there was no omission or wilful default on their part in disclosing all the material facts fully and truly, necessary for making the assessment, inasmuch as all the primary facts were in the knowledge of the Income-tax Officer and were before him, and that, therefore, no action could validly have been taken under [SECTION] of the Act."

On these premises, Mr. [ENTITY] contended that the Income-tax Officer was fully aware of the relevant facts and circumstances and that in any case all the primary facts were before the Income-tax Officer and were known to him when he finalised the assessment of the assessees for the years in question on March 28, 1957. He, therefore, contended that there was no scope in the instant case for any failure on the part of the assessees to disclose facts necessary for making the assessment of income-tax. He further submitted that the Tribunal erred in assuming that there was an omission to disclose all the necessary facts in the return. He pointed out that the words \"in his return\" are not in the section and that, therefore, even if the return did not contain the particulars, it is enough if the Income-tax Officer was informed of all relevant matters, and all material facts necessary for assessment are disclosed to him fully and truly, whether in the return or otherwise.

He placed reliance on a decision in [PRECEDENT]. In that case, at the time of the original assessment for the year 1945-46 the assessee had produced account books and balance-sheets of all his branch offices. The Income-tax Officer had these account books examined by his subordinate, the examiner of accounts, who had submitted his report; in which he had also stated that the assessee had accounts with the Exchanges Bank of India and Africa, and other banks. The assessment was made on September 13, 1946. the Income-tax Officer came to know later that the assessee had taken a draft for Rs. 1,10,000 from the Bombay branch of the aforesaid bank and deposited it on July 17, 1944, in the Ahmedabad branch of the said bank. Thereupon, the Income-tax Officer issued a notice for reassessment under [SECTION] on the 24th March, 1954, and by a revised assessment order, added the sum of Rs. 1,10,000 on the 15th October, 1954, on the ground that the assessee had omitted or failed to disclose fully and truly all the material facts necessary for his assessment for that year and that consequently the income, profits or gains chargeable to income-tax had escaped assessment. This order of the Income-tax Officer was upheld by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. But the Tribunal, after considering the account books and the examiners report, reversed this order on the ground that it could not be said on the facts and circumstances of the case that there was any omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for the year 1945-46. So holding, the Tribunal refused to make a reference to the High Court. On these facts, the Supreme Court held, following the decision in [PRECEDENT], that the one condition that must be fulfilled before the Income-tax Officer could take action under [SECTION] was that the Income-tax Officer must have had reason to believe that by reason of the omission or the failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all the material facts necessary for this assessment that year, the income, profits or gains chargeable to income-tax had escaped assessment, etc. It follows from this decision that the disclosure by the assessee need not be only by or in the return of the income, but it could be done, as was done in this case, by other means such as the accounts and other documents produced before the Income-tax Officer at the time of the original assessment.

            "\"Considering the position of the appellants in the light of the above principles it is no doubt true that the appellants were to act as the agents of the company and carry on the general management of the business of the company subject to the control and supervision of the directors. That does not however mean that they acted under the direct control and supervision of the directors in regard to the manner or method of their work. The directors were entitled to lay down the general policy and also to give such directors in regard to the management as may be considered necessary. But the day-to-day management of the business of the company as detailed in [SECTION] of the article of association and clause 3 of the agency agreement above set out was within the discretion of the appellants and apart from directing what work the appellants had to do as the agents of the company the directors had not conferred upon them the further right to direct how the work of the general management was to be done. The control and supervision of the directors was a general control and supervision and within the limits of their authority the appellants as the agents of the company had perfect discretion as to how that work of general management was to be done both in regard to the method and the manner of such work. The appellants for instance had perfect latitude to enter into agreements and contracts for such purpose and to in such manner as they thought proper. They had the power to appoint, employ, discharge, re-employ or replace the officers and servants of the company, with such powers and duties and upon such terms as to duration of office remuneration or otherwise as they thought fit. They had also the power generally to make all such arrangements and to do all such things and acts on behalf of the company, as might be necessary or expedient and as were not specifically reserved to be done by the directions. These powers did not spell a direct control and supervision of the directors as of a master over his servant but constituted the appellants, the agents of the company, who were to exercise their authority subject to the control and supervision of the directors but were not subject in such exercise to the direct control or supervision of the principals. The liberty given to the appellants under clause 4 of the agency agreement to deal with the company by way of sale and purchase of commodities therein mentioned also did not spell a relation as between master and servant but empowered the appellants to deal with the company as principals in spite of the fact that under clause 8 of the agreement two of their members for the time being were to be the ex-officio directors of the company. The power to assign the agreement and the rights of the appellants thereunder served to them under clause 9 of the agency agreement though subject to the approval and sanction of the board was hardly a power which could be vested in a servant. There was further the right to continue in employment as the agents of the company for period of 30 years from the date of the registration thereof and thereafter until the appellants of their own will resigned, which also would be hardly consistent with the employment of the appellants as mere servants of the company. The remuneration by way of commission of 2 1/2 per cent. of the amount of sale proceeds of the produce of the company savoured more of the remuneration given by a principal to his agent in the carrying out of the general management of the business of the principals and of wages or salary which would not normally be on such a basis. All these circumstances together with the power of sub-delegation reserved under [SECTION] in our opinion go to establish that the appellants were the agents of the company and not merely the servants of the company remunerated by the wages or salary.\""

            "13.First and foremost, it is pertinent to note, that this Court in its judgment in [PRECEDENT]'s case (supra) recognized, that the issue of recovery revolved on the action being iniquitous. Dealing with the subject of the action being iniquitous, it was sought to be concluded, that when the excess unauthorised payment is detected within a short period of time, it would be open for the employer to recover the same. Conversely, if the payment had been made for a long duration of time, it would be iniquitous to make any http: www.judis.nic.in [CASE NUMBER] recovery. Interference because an action is iniquitous, must really be perceived as, interference because the action is arbitrary. All arbitrary actions are truly, actions in violation of [SECTION] of the [ACT]. The logic of the action in the instant situation, is iniquitous, or arbitrary, or violative of [SECTION] of the [ACT], because it would be almost impossible for an employee to bear the financial burden, of a refund of payment received wrongfully for a long span of time. It is apparent, that a government employee is primarily dependent on his wages, and if a deduction is to be made from his/her wages, it should not be a deduction which would make it difficult for the employee to provide for the needs of his family. Besides food, clothing and shelter, an employee has to cater, not only to the education needs of those dependent upon him, but also their medical requirements, and a variety of sundry expenses. Based on the above consideration, we are of the view, that if the mistake of making a wrongful payment is detected within five years, it would be open to the employer to recover the same. However, if the payment is made for a period in excess of five years, even though it would be open to the employer to correct the mistake, it would be extremely iniquitous and arbitrary to seek a refund of the payments mistakenly made to the employee."
        ],
        [
            "Precedent",
            "14. In this context, reference may also be made to the decision rendered by this Court in [PRECEDENT], wherein this Court observed as under: \"11. Although we have held that the petitioners were http: www.judis.nic.in [CASE NUMBER] entitled only to the pay scale of Rs 330-480 in terms of the recommendations of the Third Pay Commission w.e.f. January 1, 1973 and only after the period of 10 years, they became entitled to the pay scale of Rs 330-560 but as they have received the scale of Rs 330-560 since 1973 due to no fault of theirs and that scale is being reduced in the year 1984 with effect from January 1, 1973, it shall only be just and proper not to recover any excess amount which has already been paid to them. Accordingly, we direct that no steps should be taken to recover or to adjust any excess amount paid to the petitioners due to the fault of the respondents, the petitioners being in no way responsible for the same.\"(emphasis is ours) It is apparent, that in [PRECEDENT]'s case (supra), the higher pay- scale commenced to be paid erroneously in 1973. The same was sought to be recovered in 1984, i.e., after a period of 11 years. In the aforesaid circumstances, this Court felt that the recovery after several years of the implementation of the pay-scale would not be just and proper. We therefore hereby hold, recovery of excess payments discovered after five years would be iniquitous and arbitrary, and as such, violative of [SECTION] of the [ACT]."

        [
            "Precedent",
            "15. Examining a similar proposition, this Court in [PRECEDENT], observed as under: \"28. Such relief, restraining back recovery of excess payment, is granted by courts not because of any right in the employees, but in equity, in exercise of judicial discretion to http: www.judis.nic.in [CASE NUMBER] relieve the employees from the hardship that will be caused if recovery is implemented. A government servant, particularly one in the lower rungs of service would spend whatever emoluments he receives for the upkeep of his family. If he receives an excess payment for a long period, he would spend it, genuinely believing that he is entitled to it. As any subsequent action to recover the excess payment will cause undue hardship to him, relief is granted in that behalf. But where the employee had knowledge that the payment received was in excess of what was due or wrongly paid, or where the error is detected or corrected within a short time of wrong payment, courts will not grant relief against recovery. The matter being in the realm of judicial discretion, courts may on the facts and circumstances of any particular case refuse to grant such relief against recovery.\"(emphasis is ours) A perusal of the aforesaid observations made by this Court in Col. [PRECEDENT]'s case (supra) reveals a reiteration of the legal position recorded in the earlier judgments rendered by this Court, inasmuch as, it was again affirmed, that the right to recover would be sustainable so long as the same was not iniquitous or arbitrary. In the observation extracted above, this Court also recorded, that recovery from employees in lower rung of service, would result in extreme hardship to them. The apparent explanation for the aforesaid conclusion is, that employees in lower rung of service would spend their entire earnings in the upkeep and welfare of their family, and if such excess payment is allowed to be recovered from them, it would cause them far more hardship, than the http: www.judis.nic.in [CASE NUMBER] reciprocal gains to the employer. We are therefore satisfied in concluding, that such recovery from employees belonging to the lower rungs (i.e., Class-III and Class-IV - sometimes denoted as Group 'C' and Group 'D') of service, should not be subjected to the ordeal of any recovery, even though they were beneficiaries of receiving higher emoluments, than were due to them. Such recovery would be iniquitous and arbitrary and therefore would also breach the mandate contained in [SECTION] of the [ACT]."

            "\"59. Undoubtedly, the excess amount that has been paid to the appellant teachers was not because of any misrepresentation or fraud on their part and the appellants also had no knowledge that the amount that was being paid to them was more than what they were entitled to. It would not be out of place to mention here that the Finance Department had, in its counter- affidavit, admitted that it was a bona fide mistake on their part. The excess payment made was the result of wrong interpretation of the Rule that was applicable to them, for which the appellants cannot be held responsible. Rather, the whole confusion was because of inaction, negligence and carelessness of the officials concerned of the Government of Bihar. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant teachers submitted that majority of the beneficiaries have either retired or are on the verge of it. Keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case at hand and to avoid any hardship to the appellant http: www.judis.nic.in [CASE NUMBER] teachers, we are of the view that no recovery of the amount that has been paid in excess to the appellant teachers should be made.\"(emphasis is ours) Premised on the legal proposition considered above, namely, whether on the touchstone of equity and arbitrariness, the extract of the judgment reproduced above, culls out yet another consideration, which would make the process of recovery iniquitous and arbitrary. It is apparent from the conclusions drawn in [PRECEDENT]'s case (supra), that recovery of excess payments, made from employees who have retired from service, or are close to their retirement, would entail extremely harsh consequences outweighing the monetary gains by the employer. It cannot be forgotten, that a retired employee or an employee about to retire, is a class apart from those who have sufficient service to their credit, before their retirement. Needless to mention, that at retirement, an employee is past his youth, his needs are far in excess of what they were when he was younger. Despite that, his earnings have substantially dwindled (or would substantially be reduced on his retirement). Keeping the aforesaid circumstances in mind, we are satisfied that recovery would be iniquitous and arbitrary, if it is sought to be made after the date of retirement, or soon before retirement. A period within one year from the date of superannuation, in our considered view, should be accepted as the period during which the recovery should be treated as iniquitous. Therefore, it would be justified to treat an order of recovery, on account of wrongful payment made to an employee, as arbitrary, if the recovery is sought to be made http: www.judis.nic.in [CASE NUMBER] after the employee's retirement, or within one year of the date of his retirement on superannuation."

But the High Court remitted the matter for decision on merits and the Tribunal held that the order of termination had been made by way of punishment without enquiry and hence violated [SECTION] of the [ACT]. When it was challenged in [CASE NUMBER] filed by the appellant, the High Court dismissed it by its order dated 5-3-1993, following the decision of this Court in [ENTITY] v. State of Punjab' wherein it had been held that the Court had to lift the veil and find whether the ground of termination was the foundation or the motive and if it was found to be the foundation, the termination simpliciter would be illegal. It was pointed out that the enquiry initiated, when was stopped midway it would show that the enquiry into misconduct of Respondent 1 was abandoned while enquiry into the alleged misconduct had to be completed without which the termination would become illegal. The High Court was of the opinion that the ratio in [ENTITY] was, obviously, not brought to the notice of this Court, while deciding [PRECEDENT] and [PRECEDENT] and hence they had been decided per incuriam. The High Court, therefore, applied the ratio of the decision in [ENTITY], which according to it squarely applied to Respondent 1 and held that the termination of the services of the respondent was violative of [SECTION] of the [ACT]."

What is overlooked by the High Court is that [ENTITY] case1 related to a judicial officer who had the protection of [SECTION] of the [ACT] and that, any enquiry conducted by the Executive, into an alleged misconduct of such judicial officer would be per 1 (1974) 2 SCC 931: 1974 SCC (L&S) 550 2 (1991) 1 SCC691:1991 SCC(L&S)587:(1991)16ATC498 3 1992 Supp (1) SCC 524: 1992 SCC (L&S) 440: (1992) 19 ATC 93 1: AIR 1992 SC 496 COMMISSIONER, FOOD AND CIVIL SUPPLIES v. PRAKASH C. SAXENA se illegal and without jurisdiction. In that factual matrix, this Court had to hold that an enquiry having been initiated against the delinquent, had got to be pursued to its logical conclusion, that is, till it ended either in imposition of penalty on proof of misconduct or having been found not guilty of the charge. That was the background in which this Court laid the law. The High Court has totally misunderstood the applicability of the judgment in [ENTITY]. This Court has, indeed considered in catena of decisions, the nature of power of the Government exercisable in dismissal of a temporary government servant, in terms of the order of appointment or the rules entitled [ACT]. [ENTITY] and [ENTITY] are two decisions of this Court where on consideration of the scope of the said rules, it is held that the termination simpliciter is not a penalty and the Government has power and jurisdiction under the contract of employment or the Rules to terminate simpliciter the services of a temporary government servant without conducting an enquiry and such termination simpliciter does not amount to termination for misconduct. The decisions in the said cases are being followed by this Court consistently."

Although we have found that the High Court was not right in applying the ratio of [ENTITY] to case of Respondent 1 we do not consider it necessary to interfere with its conclusion in exercise of our discretionary power under [SECTION] of the [ACT]. Therefore, while we uphold the appellant's power to terminate the services of a temporary government servant under the said rules, without holding an enquiry, we do not propose to disturb the reinstatement of Respondent 1, since he was in service as a temporary government servant for nearly 20 years before his services were terminated and he has since been retired as well from service. Taking these facts into consideration, we hold that the respondent must be deemed to have been in service from the date of the termination till the date of his superannuation, but he is not entitled to the back wages from the date of termination till the date of his filing the petition in the Services Tribunal, that is up to 31-12-1978. He will, however, be entitled to the arrears of salary from 1-1-1979 and other consequential benefits including pensionary benefits as if he had continued as a regular government servant till his superannuation.

The prosecution has miserably failed to establish the presence of eye-witnesses. Moreover, there was a delay of five hours in sending the special report to the Ilaqa Magistrate. That delay has not been explained by the prosecution. The trial Court has rightly disbelieved the presence of PW-13 [ENTITY] and PW-14 [ENTITY] as their conduct was not natural.

            "New India Industries Ltd. (NIIL) is incorporated under the [ACT] and carries on business of manufacturing photographic printing paper which became chargeable to excise duty vide tariff item No. 37- C(2) of the [ACT] (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\") with effect from March 1, 1974. NIIL had entered into distribution agreement with a firm, Agfa Gevaert (India) Ltd. (M/s [ENTITY]) for supply of goods. On 8.5.1974 the Department served show cause notice on NIIL (Manufacturer) to explain why prices declared by the company vide letter dated 7.3.1974 should not be rejected as wholesale cash price and why prices charges by M/s [ENTITY] to its dealers should not be approved in terms of [SECTION] of the said Act. On 13.12.1974 the Department confirmed the show cause notice and directed NIIL to pay excise duty on the prices charges by M/s [ENTITY] to its dealers. In pursuance of the said order, a notice of demand dated 3.1.1975 was served on NIIL demanding excise duty of Rs.99,631/- for the period 1.3.1974 to 20.5.1974 which NIIL paid, Under Protest, and carried on appeal to the Appellate Collector. On 8.1.1976 the said appeal was dismissed. NIIL moved the High Court under [SECTION] of the [ACT] vide [CASE NUMBER] challenging the order holding that the liability of NIIL to pay excess duty should be ascertained by the price charged by M/s [ENTITY] to its dealers. The petition was subsequently withdrawn. On 15.9.1975, NIIL addressed a latter to the Department submitting a declaration stating that M/s [ENTITY] is not related to NIIL in terms of [SECTION] of the said Act. On 1.10.1975, the said [SECTION] of the Act was amended and the concept of \"related person\" was introduced. On 11.11.1975, NIIL was asked by the Department to pay excise duty on the price charged by M/s [ENTITY] to its dealers. NIIL went in appeal which was dismissed on 21.9.1979. On 31.10.1984 the Department approved the ex-factory price of NIIL instead of the price list of M/s [ENTITY] to its dealers. Therefore, from 1.11.1984, NIIL started paying excise duty on the ex-factory price charged by NIIL to M/s [ENTITY] and not on price charged by M/s [ENTITY] to its dealers. ON 11.8.1986, NIIL filed refund claims for Rs.60,19,238.65 for recovery of excise duty between the period 1.11.1981 to 31.10.1984. On 29.9.1986 another refund claim for Rs.42,77,358.59 was lodged for recovery of excise duty during the period 1.11.1978 to 31.10.1981. Similarly on 7.4.1987 another refund claim was lodged for excise duty paid in excess during the period 1.3.1974 to 31.10.1978 by NIIL amounting to Rs.22,38,391.72. These refund claims were made in view of judgment of this Court in the case of [PRECEDENT]. On 7.4.1987, NIIL made a consolidated refund claim of Rs. 1,25,34,988.97 for the entire period from 1.3.1974 to 31.10.1984. In respect of these refund claims the Department served a show cause notice and ultimately the Assistant Collector granted refund to NIIL only for two months preceding the lodgment of the claim. On 13.4.1987, NIIL filed [CASE NUMBER] in the High Court challenging the order of Assistant Collector denying refund except for two months. That writ petition came for hearing before learned Single Judge on 29.8.1988. The learned Judge held that the action of the Department in collecting duty not on the sale price of NIIL to M/s [ENTITY] was illegal and, therefore, NIIL was entitled to refund. However, since the question of unjust enrichment was debatable, the learned Judge referred the question to the Full Bench. After the decision of the Full Bench in the case of [PRECEDENT], the said [CASE NUMBER] was reposted before the learned Judge on 17.1.1990 when he directed Union of India to prove that the tax burden has in fact been shifted to consumers. Pending further examination, the Department was directed to deposit Rs.1,25,34,988.97 in Court. When the Writ Petition came for hearing on 22.3.1990, NIIL conceded that it had passed on the burden to M/s [ENTITY], the sole-selling distributors of NIIL. The learned Judge, however, directed M/s [ENTITY] to file affidavit stating whether it had passed on the burden to its dealers or not. Therefore on 22.3.1990 the refund claims of NIIL were rejected but the learned Judge went into further enquiry as to whether the burden had been passed on by M/s [ENTITY] to its dealers and by judgment dated 14.6.1990 held that Union of India had failed to prove that M/s [ENTITY] had passed on the burden to its dealers and accordingly granted refund of Rs.1,25,34,988.97 to M/s [ENTITY]. Being aggrieved, the Department carried the matter in appeal to the Division Bench which took the view that since NIIL had conceded of having passed on the tax burden to M/s [ENTITY] there was no question of the trial court further examining the question as to whether M/s [ENTITY] had passed on the burden to its dealers. Accordingly, the Division Bench allowed the appeal filed by the Department vide judgment dated 2.3.1993. Being aggrieved, NIIL came to this Court vide [CASE NUMBER]. By order dated 30.1.1997, this Court disposed of the SLP observing that since NIIL had passed on the burden of excise duty to M/s [ENTITY] the refund claims filed by NIIL are liable to be rejected."

            "Facts",
            "Accordingly, the said SLP was dismissed. However it was clarified that the said Order will not prevent M/s [ENTITY] from adopting appropriate remedy as open to it in law. In view of the order dated 30.1.1997 passed by this Court, M/s [ENTITY] filed [CASE NUMBER] in the High Court contending that the petitioners ([ENTITY]) were entitled to refund of Rs.1,25,34,988.97 as sole selling distributors of NIIL. That as distributors they ([ENTITY]) were not related to NIIL. That their transaction was at arms length and therefore, the Department had erred in collecting excess excise duty from NIIL on the basis of the prices charged by M/s [ENTITY] to its dealers. In the Writ Petition, M/s [ENTITY] relied on the judgment of this Court in the case of [PRECEDENT] (supra). By order dated 28.9.1993 passed by the High Court, the Department was allowed to withdraw Rs.1,25,34,988.97 with undertaking to bring back the amount with interest as and when the Court so directs. In the meantime on 19.12.1996 this Court delivered its judgment in [ENTITY]'s case (supra) inter alia giving 60 days' time to those claimants, who had earlier adopted legal proceedings claiming refund to move under [SECTION] as amended w.e.f. 20.9.1991. Consequently, M/s [ENTITY] moved their refund claim before the Department on 11.2.1997 for Rs.1,25,34,988.97. On 9.5.1997, a show cause notice was issued by the Department to M/s [ENTITY] (formerly known as M/s [ENTITY]) calling upon them to show cause why Rs.1,25,34,988.97 should not be transferred to Consumer Welfare Fund. By judgment and order dated 31.10.1997 passed by the Assistant Commissioner refund was granted to M/s Allied Photographics India (P) Ltd. (M/s [ENTITY]). This order of Assistant Commissioner was confirmed in appeal by the Commissioner (Appeals) and the Tribunal vide impugned order dated 13.6.2000 and the Department was directed to refund Rs.1,25,34,988.97 with interest. Being aggrieved, the Department has come to this Court by way of present civil appeal under [SECTION] of the Act."

            "Issue",
            "Mr. [ENTITY], learned senior counsel for the Department submitted that there was a difference between provisional assessment under [SECTION] and payment of duty under protest in terms of [SECTION] In this connection reliance was placed on the judgment of this Court in [ENTITY]'s case (supra). He submitted that under the second proviso to [SECTION] if duty is paid by the manufacturer under protest the limitation of six months was not applicable, however, the purchaser of duty paid goods, after finalization of assessment of excise duty payable by the manufacturer, was not entitled to rely upon the said proviso. That in any event in the present case, M/s [ENTITY] (the respondent-herein) had claimed refund by filing an independent application on 11.2.1997 and therefore it was governed by [SECTION]. In support reliance was placed on para 104 of the [ENTITY]'s case. It was submitted that the abovementioned two decisions of this Court in the cases of [PRECEDENT] and [PRECEDENT] run counter to the law laid down by this Court in [ENTITY]'s case and a clarification to that effect was required in the interest of justice. Learned counsel next contended that M/s [ENTITY] as the sole distributor of NIIL had bought the products in the course of trading between 1974 and 1984 and had sold them to its dealers earning profits between 12.6535% to 21.1333%. That during the said period, the purchaser had no right to claim refund and that M/s [ENTITY] became entitled to claim refund only after 20.9.1991 when [SECTION] was amended by the [ACT] when such right was recognized for the first time and, therefore, there was no reason for M/s [ENTITY] not to pass on the burden to its dealers. That M/s [ENTITY] not only passed on the burden to its dealers but even admittedly made profits on its sales. That the consideration paid by M/s [ENTITY] to NIIL included excise duty and the very fact that M/s [ENTITY] recovered all its expenses and made profits in all its sales to its dealers itself establishes that incidence of duty was passed on to the dealers by M/s [ENTITY] in the course of its trading business. It was further urged that M/s [ENTITY] had never moved any refund claim prior to 8.6.1990 and that it filed its affidavit on that day in response to suo-moto notice issued by the High Court in the Writ Petition filed by NIIL inter alia for refund whereby for the first time M/s [ENTITY] contended that it had not passed on the burden to its dealers. In this connection, M/s [ENTITY] asserted that the excess duty component was negligible amount of 1.62% of its sale price; that it had earned profits varying from 12.6535% to 21.1333% and therefore it absorbed the burden of excess duty within its profit and that it gave a trade discount varying from 2% to 4% to its customers which itself was more than the burden of additional duty. However, on behalf of the Department it was contended that excess duty component was a part of cost incurred by M/s [ENTITY] during the above period 1974/1984 and there is no reason why M/s [ENTITY] did not recover it from its dealers particularly when M/s [ENTITY] had no right as a purchaser to claim refund which was recognized only on 20.9.1991 when [SECTION] was amended and therefore, M/s [ENTITY] was seeking to unjustly enrich itself by seeking such refund. Lastly, it was urged that M/s [ENTITY] had worked out its sale prices before the Department in such a way that it has not passed the burden to its dealers and yet it has earned profits varying from 12.6535% to 21.1333% which was contrary to normal conduct of a trader. In this connection it was further submitted that M/s [ENTITY] did not produce any material before the Department disclosing how its sale price were arrived at."

            "Per contra, Shri [ENTITY], learned senior counsel for the respondent \u0016 M/s [ENTITY] submitted that M/s [ENTITY] as the purchaser was entitled to claim refund of the excess duty as that amount had been passed on by NIIL to M/s [ENTITY]. In this connection reliance was placed on judgments of this Court in the case of [ENTITY] (supra) and in the case of [PRECEDENT]. Learned counsel for the respondent contended that in the present case [SECTION] was not at all attracted. In support he pointed out that during the period 1974 to 1984, the Department insisted on NIIL paying excise duty on the footing that M/s [ENTITY] was related to NIIL. That the Department insisted on NIIL paying the additional excise duty of 1.62% on the footing that M/s [ENTITY] was related person to NIIL. However in 1984 assessments of NIIL were finalized in terms of judgment of this Court in the case of [PRECEDENT] (supra) wherein it was held that the distributor could not be treated as a \"related person\" and accordingly the amounts paid by NIIL towards excise duty during 1974-84 were adjusted and appropriated against the amounts found payable on the said assessments and consequently the disputed amount of excess duty of 1.62% paid by NIIL under protest during the above period became refundable on the finalization of NIIL's assessments in 1984. That neither NIIL nor M/s [ENTITY] ever disputed the said assessments made in 1984 and M/s [ENTITY] had based their refund claim on the said assessment. It was submitted that when a provisional assessment is made under the Act or when excise duty is paid Under Protest by the appellant, all payments of excise duty are On Account payments which are to be adjusted and appropriated only on vacating of the protest or finalization of assessment. In this connection, reliance was placed on [SECTION] as it stood prior to its amendment in 1989 and [SECTION]. In either situations, when the assessment is finalized or the protest is vacated and the account is settled between the appellant and the Department and the said On Account payments made by the appellant are adjusted and appropriated against the assessed amount and if it is found that any amount is payable by the appellant then it can be recovered by the Department without issuance of show cause-cum-demand notice under [SECTION]"

        [
            "Argument by Respondent",
            "Correspondingly, if any amount is found to be repayable by the Department to the appellant on such taking of accounts, then that amount has to be refunded without going through [SECTION] In this connection reliance was placed on the judgment of this Court in the case of [PRECEDENT]. According to the learned counsel the same principle was applicable in cases where the Department has to refund moneys to the appellant on finalization of the assessment; which principle has been reiterated vide para 104 of the [ENTITY] judgment. Accordingly it was submitted that the doctrine of unjust enrichment in [SECTION] would not apply to the present case. Lastly it was urged that the argument of the Department was based entirely on [SECTION] which had no bearing on the basic issue as to whether [SECTION] was at all applicable particularly when the appellant was seeking refund of an \"On account\" payment made Under Protest or under the Provisional assessment\". Therefore, the reliance on [SECTION] was misplaced. That in the circumstances, neither Sinkhai Synthetics nor T.V.S. Suzuki can be said to be in any way incorrect, much less per incuriam. On merits, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the question as to whether the burden of duty has been passed on to the consumer is to be answered by relying on one singular test viz. whether the manufacturer has increased his sale price in order to pass on the disputed amount and not whether the manufacturer has made profits or losses. In this connection, reliance was placed on judgments of the Appellate Tribunal having been accepted by the Department that composition of costs incurred by M/s [ENTITY] was not relevant and the only relevant factor was whether M/s [ENTITY] had increased its sale price to its dealers after it was required to pay the differential amount of excise duty in the form of the increased price charged to it by NIIL. In this connection it was submitted that M/s [ENTITY] did not increase its sale price after it was required to bear the differential amount of excise duty of 1.62% in the form of the enhanced purchase price paid by it to NIIL and on the contrary, far from enhancing its sale prices, M/s [ENTITY] granted discounts between 2% to 4% on the sale price charged by it to its dealers and this discount was more than the disputed differential amount of excise duty which came to 1.62% of the price. It was submitted that the case of M/s [ENTITY] has been accepted by all the authorities below and that this Court should not interfere with the concurrent findings of fact recorded by the authorities below. In this connection it was submitted that the said findings were based on the audited accounts of [ENTITY]; certificate of Chartered Accountant, Sale Invoices of [ENTITY] and two affidavits filed on behalf of [ENTITY]. It was further urged that in the case of [ENTITY] (supra) it has been held that where the claim for refund relates to the period prior to 20.9.1991, any evidence which reasonably shows that the disputed duty has not been passed on to the dealers/customers in the form of increased price would suffice and the claimant is not required to produce documents specified in [SECTION] which has prospective operation. Hence, M/s [ENTITY] (respondents herein) had not increased the sale price for recovering the additional disputed duty burden of 1.62% which was passed on to it (M/s [ENTITY]) by NIIL. Learned counsel for the respondent next contended that profits made by it during the period 1974 to 1984 does not indicate passing on of the duty burden to its dealers. It was contended that profit or loss is not the determinative factor in order to ascertain whether the disputed additional duty is passed on by the respondent to its dealers. In the circumstances, it was submitted that on the said material and evidence and having regard to the specific findings the only possible conclusion was that the respondent, M/s [ENTITY] had not passed on the disputed duty burden to its dealers/customers."

            "Before analysing [SECTION], it is important to note that there is a difference between making of refund and claiming of refund. [SECTION] was inserted in the said Act w.e.f. 17.11.1980. Under [SECTION] to explanation B to [SECTION], where assessment was made provisionally the relevant date for commencement of limitation of six months was the date of adjustment of duty as final assessment. Entitlement to refund would thus be known only when duty was finally adjusted. Sub- clause (e) referred to limitation in cases covered by [SECTION] which dealt with duty paid under provisional assessment. The said rule started with a non-obstante clause. [SECTION] indicated the circumstances in which the proper officer would allow provisional assessment. [SECTION] dealt with clearance of goods provisionally assessed whereas [SECTION] dealt with adjustment of provisionally assessed duty against finally assessed duty. The said [SECTION] was a complete code by itself. On compliance with the conditions therein, the proper officer was duty bound to refund the duty without requiring the assessee to make a separate refund application. The said rule, therefore, provided for making of refund. On the other hand, [SECTION] dealt with claiming of refund by the person who has paid duty on his own accord. In this connection, [SECTION] of the said Act is relevant. In the case of [PRECEDENT] (supra) it has been held that [SECTION] of the Act refers to levy of duty whereas [SECTION] dealt with assessment. Assessment means determination of the tax liability. Under the Act, duty was payable by the manufacturer on his own account. Hence, under [SECTION], such a person had to claim refund by making an application within six months from the relevant date except in cases where duty was paid under protest in terms of the proviso. However, even in such cases, the person claiming refund had to pay the duty under protest in terms of prescribed rules.

We do not find any merit in this argument. As discussed, there is a basic difference between duty paid under protest and duty paid under [SECTION] The duty paid under protest falls under [SECTION] whereas duty paid under provisional assessment falls under [SECTION] That [SECTION] deals with claim for refund whereas [SECTION] deals with making of refund, in which case the assessee has not to comply with [SECTION] Therefore, [SECTION] and [SECTION] operate in different spheres and, consequently, in para 104 of the said judgment, it has been held that in cases where duty is paid under [SECTION] and refund arises on adjustment under [SECTION], then such refund will not be governed by [SECTION] In the said para, it has been clarified that if an independent refund claim is made after adjustment on final assessment under [SECTION], agitating the same issues, then such claim would attract [SECTION] This is because when the assessee makes an independent refund claim after final orders under [SECTION], such application represents a claim for refund and, it would not come in the category of making of refund and therefore, the bar of unjust enrichment would apply. Hence, there is no merit in the contention of the respondent M/s [ENTITY] that although in this case duty was paid under protest, there was no difference between such payment and duty paid under provisional assessment under the said Act. This argument was obviously advanced because unless the two payments are equated as contended, the respondent M/s [ENTITY] was required to comply with [SECTION] In this matter, duty has been paid under protest.

            "Argument by Respondent",
            "The point which still remains to be decided is \u0017 whether the respondent herein was entitled to refund without complying with [SECTION] of the Act on the ground that it had stepped into the shoes of NIIL (manufacturer) which had paid the duty under protest. It was argued on behalf of the respondent that NIIL had paid the excise duty under protest pending final assessment, which was ultimately decided in favour of NIIL and since NIIL had sold the product to the respondent herein, the respondent was entitled to the benefit of the second proviso to [SECTION] which inter alia stated that limitation of six months shall not apply where duty had been paid under protest. We do not find any merit in this argument. In the case of [PRECEDENT] (supra), it has been held by this Court that [SECTION] of the said Act is a charging section whereas [SECTION] is a computation section which covers assessment and collection of excise duty. That the basis of assessment under [SECTION] was the real value of excisable goods which included manufacturing cost and manufacturing profit but excluded selling cost and selling profit. That the price charged by the manufacturer for sale of the goods represented the real value of the goods for assessment of excise duty. In the case of [PRECEDENT], this Court has held that the resale price charged by a wholesale dealer who buys goods from the manufacturer cannot be included in the real value of excisable goods in terms of [SECTION] of the said Act. Therefore, it is clear that the basis on which a manufacturer claims refund is different from the basis on which a buyer claims refund. The cost of purchase to the buyer consists of purchase price including taxes and duties payable on the date of purchase (other than the refund which is subsequently recoverable by the buyer from the Department). Consequently, it is not open to the buyer to include the refund amount in the cost of purchase on the date when he buys the goods as the right to refund accrues to him at a date after completion of the purchase depending upon his success in the assessment. Lastly, as stated above, [SECTION] dealt with claim for refund of duty. It did not deal with making of refund. Therefore, [SECTION] stated that no refund shall be made except in terms of [SECTION]. [SECTION] conferred a right on the buyer to claim refund in cases where he proved that he had not passed on the duty to any other person. The entire scheme of [SECTION] showed the difference between the rights of a manufacturer to claim refund and the right of the buyer to claim refund as separate and distinct. Moreover, under [SECTION] of the said Act, every payment by the manufacturer whether under protest or under provisional assessment was on his own account. The accounts of the manufacturer are different from the accounts of a buyer (distributor). Consequently, there is no merit in the argument advanced on behalf of the respondent that the distributor was entitled to claim refund of \"on account\" payment made under protest by the manufacturer without complying with [SECTION] of the Act."

            "As stated above, para 104 of the judgment in the case [ENTITY] Industries Ltd. (supra) states that if refund arises upon finalization of provisional assessment, [SECTION] will not apply. Para 104 of the said judgment does not deal with payment under protest. In the light of what is stated herein, we may now consider the judgment of this Court in the case [PRECEDENT] (supra). In that matter, the assessee was a manufacturer. The assessee claimed exemption which was denied by the Department. The assessee went in appeal to CEGAT. Pending appeal, assessee paid excise duty under protest. The assessee succeeded before the CEGAT and claimed refund on 17.1.1991. Refund was denied by the Department. Therefore, it was a case of payment of duty under protest. However, in the said decision, this Court applied para 104 of the judgment of the [ACT] Bench in the case of [ENTITY] Industries Ltd. (supra), which with respect, had no application. As stated above, para 104 of the judgment in the case of [ENTITY] Industries Ltd.

This distinction is missed out, with respect, by the judgment of this Court in the case of [ENTITY] Industries Ltd. (supra). We may also point out that the judgment in the case of [PRECEDENT] (supra) is based on the concession made by the counsel appearing on behalf of the Department. That judgment is, therefore, per incuriam. Learned counsel for the respondent herein placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in the case of [PRECEDENT] (supra). In that case, application for refund was filed. This was on completion of final assessment. On 9.7.1996, the Department issued a show-cause notice as to why the refund claim should not be rejected for non-compliance of [SECTION] By order dated 17.7.1996, the refund claim was rejected on the ground that it was beyond limitation. On appeal, the Commissioner (Appeals) observed that the bar of unjust enrichment was not applicable as the assessee claimed refund consequent upon final assessment. He allowed the refund claim. CEGAT agreed with the view of Commissioner (Appeals). Before this Court, the Department conceded rightly that in view of para 104 of the judgment of this Court in [ENTITY] Industries Ltd. (supra), bar of unjust enrichment was not applicable in cases of refund consequent upon adjustment under [SECTION].

Mr. [ENTITY], learned senior counsel however submitted that this Court should not interfere, under [SECTION] of the [ACT], in view of the concurrent finding of fact given by the authorities below that the respondent has not passed on the incidence of duty to its dealers. We do not find any merit in this argument. In May, 1974, the Department took the view that price declared by NIIL in its price list cannot be accepted as assessable value of excisable goods and price at which their sole distributor M/s [ENTITY] sold the goods represented the correct price. Accordingly, on 8.5.1974 show-cause notice was issued to NIIL as to why the prices submitted by NIIL should not be rejected and why excise duty should not be collected from NIIL on the prices at which their distributor M/s [ENTITY] sold the goods in the market. By order dated 31.12.1974, the Department held that the transactions between NIIL and M/s [ENTITY] (predecessor of the respondent herein) were not at arms length and accordingly it was ordered that the prices charged by the distributor M/s [ENTITY] should be taken as a wholesale cash price under [SECTION] of the said Act, as it stood at the relevant time. However, later on, in view of the judgment of this Court in the case of [PRECEDENT] (supra) the Department approved the price list of NIIL vide order dated 31.10.1984 and accepted the ex-factory price of NIIL. On the basis of the said order, NIIL claimed refund of Rs.1,25,34,988.97 on which the Department issued show- cause notice on 23.2.1987 calling upon NIIL to show- cause why the said amount should not be credited to the Consumer Welfare Account. NIIL objected. However, their objection was rejected. Thereafter, the litigation took place as stated above. Ultimately, vide order dated 31.10.1997, the Assistant Commissioner Central Excise granted refund, which order was confirmed in appeal by the Commissioner (Appeals) and by CEGAT. Hence, the Department has come by way of the present Civil Appeal."

        [
            "Argument by Respondent",
            "On the above facts, the short point which arises for determination is \u0017 whether incidence of duty was passed on by NIIL to its distributor M/s [ENTITY] and whether M/s [ENTITY] in turn passed on the burden to its dealers. On the first point, NIIL conceded in the earlier proceedings before the High Court that it had passed on the duty burden to its distributor M/s [ENTITY]. Therefore, the only question which we are required to decide is \u0016 whether M/s [ENTITY] in turn had passed on the duty burden to its dealers as alleged. In the present case, it was argued on behalf of the Department before the authorities below that 20% of the total price paid by M/s [ENTITY] represented the duty recovered by NIIL as a part of the sale price. It is important to note that M/s [ENTITY] was the sole distributor of NIIL. Therefore, it is highly improbable for a distributor to incur cost of purchase which included 20% element of duty in addition to the purchase price without passing on the burden to its dealers. From the record, it appears that during the disputed period 1974 to 1984, M/s [ENTITY] were in trading which further supports the above improbability. In the present case, there is no material placed on record by M/s [ENTITY] as to how it had accounted for the cost of purchase in its books and the accounting treatment it gave to the said item at the time of payment of the purchase price. No record as to costing of that item has been produced. This material was relevant as in the present case NIIL conceded that it had passed on the burden of duty to its distributor M/s [ENTITY] (buyer) and it was the buyer who claimed refund. It has been urged on behalf of the respondent and which argument has been accepted by the Authorities below that 20% of the total price paid by M/s [ENTITY] to NIIL represented total excess excise duty levied and not the excess duty collected by NIIL in the form of sale price from its distributor M/s NIIL. It was argued that excess duty collected by NIIL represented only 1.62% of the total price. It was argued that resale price charged by M/s [ENTITY] to its dealers had no relevance to excess excise duty paid by M/s [ENTITY] to NIIL at the time of purchase as the sale price charged by M/s [ENTITY] to its dealers was based on the prevailing market price. We do not find any merit in this argument. In the present case, the refund claim is made by a buyer and not by the manufacturer. The buyer says that he has not passed on the burden to its dealers. The buyer has bought the goods from the manufacturer paying the purchase price which included cost of purchase plus taxes and duties on the date of purchase. In such cases, cost of purchase to the buyer is a relevant factor. None of the authorities below have looked into this aspect. Even the appellate Tribunal has not gone into this relevant factor. It has merely quoted the passages from the order of the lower authority, whose order was impugned before it. Costing of the goods in the hands of the distributor, the cost element and the treatment given to purchases by the buyer in his own account were relevant circumstances which the Authorities below failed to examine. It was submitted that cost of purchase was not a relevant factor. It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that the resale price charged by the buyer was not a relevant factor. It was submitted that since the sale price of the goods before and after the assessment remained the same the burden of excess duty was absorbed by the respondent. It was submitted that in any event the sale price of the goods increased much less than the amount of duty (differential) involved in this case and, therefore, incidence of duty was not passed on to the consumers. In this connection, reliance was placed on several judgments of the Tribunal. We have gone through these judgments. They are not applicable to the facts of this case. In the present case, we are concerned with the distributor buying the products from the manufacturer and reselling them to its dealers. Hence, the cost of purchase is a relevant factor. The facts of the cases before the Tribunal deal with sale by manufacturer to the consumer. They deal with assessees' invoice bearing a composite price. They are the cases which dealt with the claim of refund by the manufacturer. They did not deal with claim of refund by the buyer. Hence, they have no bearing on the facts of the present case."

            "Conclusion",
            "Before concluding, we may state that uniformity in price before and after the assessment does not lead to the inevitable conclusion that incidence of duty has not been passed on to the buyer as such uniformity may be due to various factors. Hence, even on merits, the respondent has failed to make out a case for refund. Since relevant factors stated above have not been examined by the authorities below, we do not find merit in the contention of the respondent that this Court should not interfere under [SECTION] of the [ACT] in view of the concurrent finding of fact."

Dibrugarh, Pin - 786 001. Appellant/Complainant - VERSUS - Mr. [ENTITY], Son of Matinur Rahman (Retired SE, PWD), Resident of Milanpur, Chandmari, Bamuni Maidam, P.S. Chandmari, [ENTITY] - 21, Dist. Kamrup, Assam. Respondent/Accused. BEFORE Hon'ble Mr. Justice [ENTITY] Advocate for the appellant : Mr. AB Chowdhury, Sr. Advocate. Mr. [ENTITY], Mr. MA Choudhury, Advocate. Advocate for Respondent : Mr. [ENTITY], Ms. [ENTITY], Mr. MAI Hussain., Advocate. Date of hearing 07th June, 2017. Date of Judgment & Order 13th of June, 2017. JUDGMENT & ORDER This appeal, under [SECTION] of the [ACT], is directed against the judgment and order dated 16-07-2013, passed by the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate (Sadar), Dibrugarh, in [CASE NUMBER], acquitting the accused, namely, [ENTITY], under [SECTION] of the [ACT]. [CASE NUMBER] Page 1 of 17 2. I have heard Mr. [ENTITY], learned counsel appearing on behalf of complainant-appellant, and Mr. [ENTITY], learned counsel, for accused-respondent. 3. The prosecution case, in brief, is that the appellant, [ENTITY], as complainant, filed a complaint under [SECTION] of the [ACT] (in short, '[ACT]') at Dibrugarh, on 26-07-2011, which gave rise to [CASE NUMBER]. The Court of learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate (Sadar), Dibrugarh, took cognizance of the case under [SECTION] of [ACT], and at the end of the trial, the accused was acquitted due to lack of territorial jurisdiction to try the case as well as on merit. 4. The allegation made in the complaint is that, the accused/respondent took an amount of Rs.45 Lakhs from the complainant for his business investment on condition that he would return the same within a specified time. But the accused/respondent did not return the amount to the complainant/appellant. After repeated requests and reminders, the accused issued an account payee cheque of H.D.F.C. Bank, Khanapara, [ENTITY], bearing cheque No.265556 dated 15-01-2011, to the complainant/appellant. The complainant/appellant deposited the cheque in Axis Bank, Dibrugarh on 27-04-2011 for collection. However, the cheque was dishonoured by HDFC Bank. The complainant deposited the cheque for the second time on 28-05-11, on the advice of the accused and, this time too, the cheque was dishonoured. On query, complainant/appellant came to know that there was insufficiency of fund in the account of the accused/respondent. 5. Then, the complainant/appellant issued a legal notice to the accused/respondent under registered post on 09-06-2011 from Dibrugarh, which he received on 13-06-2011. The accused, inspite of [CASE NUMBER] Page 2 of 17 receipt of the notice, did not make the payment within the statutory period. Hence, the complaint. 6. The accused/respondent appeared before the learned Sub- Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Dibrugarh and contested the proceedings. 7. After conclusion of the trial, the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Dibrugarh, by the impugned judgment and order, acquitted the accused. 8. In his appeal, the complainant/appellant has taken the following grounds: a. That, learned Magistrate has committed an illegality in holding that the learned Magistrate has no territorial jurisdiction after taking cognizance of the offence under [SECTION] of the [ACT], moreover after conclusion of the trial. b. That, the cheque, in question, having been presented to the Axis Bank at Dibrugarh for payment and the cheque having been dishonoured at Dibrugarh, cause of action arose at Dibrugarh. Hence, learned Magistrate committed a glaring illegality in holding that he had no territorial jurisdiction to decide the case and thus caused serious failure of justice. c. That, the learned Magistrate has misinterpreted the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in regard to \"the territorial jurisdiction of a Court to try an offence under [SECTION] of the [ACT]\". d. That, the learned Magistrate ought not to have acquitted the accused/respondent rather returned the complaint for presentation to the proper Court, as provided in [SECTION] [ACT] e. That, the learned Magistrate ought not to have entertained the objection regarding territorial jurisdiction at the stage of argument. f. The findings of the learned Court below that the Court has no jurisdiction is perverse being contrary to the materials on record and the law, for which the impugned judgment is liable to be set aside and quashed. 9. On a reading of the judgment, under challenge in the instant appeal, it would be apparent that learned SDJM (S) has acquitted the [CASE NUMBER] Page 3 of 17 accused/respondent on the basis of findings on territorial jurisdiction recorded in Paragraphs-12 and 14 of the impugned judgment. 10. In paragraphs 12 and 14 of the impugned judgment, the learned trial Court dealt with jurisdiction part. For the sake of convenience, Paragraphs 12 and 14 are extracted below: \"12. The alleged cheque or Ext-2 was issued at [ENTITY] on the drawee bank at [ENTITY]. Simply by depositing the cheque in different places, territorial jurisdiction cannot be changed. The entire transaction as alleged took place within the jurisdiction of [ENTITY]. Hence, the case is liable to be dismissed for the want of territorial jurisdiction. Most often people are confused about the place where criminal complaint can be filed under the [ACT], as the Act is silent on this matter. Since the Criminal courts are approached, the issue needs to be examined from the point of view of the [ACT]. [SECTION] of [ACT] provides that every offence shall ordinarily be inquired into and tried by a Court within whose local jurisdiction it was committed. [SECTION] provides that offence may be tried at by a court having jurisdiction over any of the local areas where offence is committed. It is possible that an offence may be committed in several local areas or partly in one area and partly in another area. It is also possible that some times offence may consist of several acts done in different areas In all the above situations, the court having jurisdiction over any of such local areas may try the offence. The judgment of Supreme Court in [PRECEDENT] dealt with this issue elaborately. The Hon'ble Supreme court opined that offence can be completed only with concatenation of a number of acts, namely, drawing of cheque, presentation of cheque, returning of the cheque by the bank, notice by payee and failure of drawer of cheque within 15 days of receipt of notice. Any one of the courts under whose jurisdiction the above acts have taken place can try the offence. In other words complainant can file compliant in any one of the courts where the cause of arises or acts have been committed. In [PRECEDENT] the Hon'ble supreme court had the occasion to examine the issue of jurisdiction again. In this case the appellant is a resident of Chandigarh issued a cheque which was dishonored. The cheque [CASE NUMBER] Page 4 of 17 was issued at Chandigarh where the complainant had a branch and was presented at Chandigarh. Notice demanding payment however was issued by the complainant from its Head office at Delhi to the accused's office at Chandigarh. On failure to respond to the notice, a complaint was filed in Delhi. Both lower court and High court have placed reliance on [ENTITY] and Anr. case and held that Delhi court also has jurisdiction. The Appellant/Respondent in appeal contended that Chandigarh court had jurisdiction to try the offence but his appeal was dismissed. But in appeal, the Supreme Court held that a court derives jurisdiction when a cause of action arises. Jurisdiction cannot be conferred for any act of omission or commission on the part of the accused. Issuance of notice would not give rise to cause of action but communication of the notice would and therefore Delhi High court would not have jurisdiction and it directed for transfer of the case pending in Delhi to Chandigarh court. In the given case all the acts took place including issuance of Ext-2 in [ENTITY] and the complainant invested the said amount in J & J Firm In [ENTITY] owned by the accused so the complainant cannot file the case at Dibrugarh as this court has no jurisdiction to entertain it although complainant has bank account at Dibrugarh and presented the Ext-2 cheque through his banker by serving legal notice at the address of the accused at Milanpur, Chandmari ([ENTITY]). 14. Under the circumstance, the accused prays that the above case may be dismissed for the ends of justice. From above this court has no jurisdiction to try such case at Dibrugarh as cause of action had taken place in [ENTITY]. To this contrary the learned advocate for the complainant contends that the place of registered office of the complainant can be held to be a place where part of the cause of action accrued and the magistrate have the power in that territory will have the jurisdiction to entertain the complainant. Where the accused did not deny the liability in respect of dishonored cheque, the order of his acquittal for the offence under [SECTION] was not proper. There is no iota of proof that the monetary transaction was taken place only at Dibrugarh but in [ENTITY] but mostly in [ENTITY] as J and J firm lies in [ENTITY]all the transactions had taken place between the PW-1 and the accused for the investment of the cheque amount in J and J Investment firm in [ENTITY]. It cannot be discarded as stated by PW-1.It is further contended by the accused counsel that deposit of cheque at Dibrugarh would not confer jurisdiction on Dibrugarh court to entertain the complaint petition which has no territorial jurisdiction as the cause of action [CASE NUMBER] Page 5 of 17 had taken place in [ENTITY]. To this effect the accused has relied the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in [PRECEDENT] accused had not issued the cheque due to his legally enforceable debt to the PW-1. On the other hand the complainant advocate strenuously objected of the above fact pointing out that in course of cross-examination of the complainant specifically replied that he collected the amount from his uncles, sisters, aunt, etc. of Panchali, Dibrugarh, Naliapool, [ENTITY], etc. and made the payment to the accused person who was present at Dibrugarh at the time of taking the amount from the relatives of the complainant with one of his friends [ENTITY] which could not be rebutted by the defence. Mere address of [ENTITY] in the visiting card of the accused person is not sufficient to prove that the transaction took place in [ENTITY]. The accused person when visited the residence of the complainant at Dibrugarh to take the amount gave the visiting card to the complainant at Dibrugarh. The accused person's side took the plea that the drawer bank is Khanapara Branch of HDFC Bank but in the cheque itself which was issued under the signature of the accused person it specifically written that the amount of the cheque is payable at any branch of HDFC bank which is the commitment of the accused person himself, from his such commitment the accused person cannot turn his face in any case, accordingly the cheque was deposited by the complainant at his bank, Axis Bank and as it is written in the cheque that the amount of the cheque is payable at any branch of HDFC Bank, the Axis Bank sent the cheque to the HDFC Bank, Dibrugarh branch for collection of the amount and the HDFC Bank dishonoured the cheque on the ground of \"Stopped payment\" and after that notice was issued to the accused person through registered post to his correct and proper address as per [SECTION] of the [ACT] where the notice is sent by the registered post to an addressee to his correct address it will be presumed that the notice has duly been served upon the addressee. As the A/D Card was not received back by the sender, the advocate for the complainant made correspondence with the postal department and the postal department confirmed the delivery of the notice to the addressee and the letter of the postal department has been exhibited in the case. The citations of Hon'ble Delhi High Court and the Hon'ble Supreme Court do not match with the present case. It is not mentioned in the citation anywhere that the contention of the cheque in those particular cases is same with the cheque of the present case. The cheque of the present case was drawable at any branch of [CASE NUMBER] Page 6 of 17 Bank and as such any branch of the HDFC Bank whenever the cheque was sent is the drawer bank and since in the present case the cheque was sent to the HDFC Bank, Dibrugarh Branch for withdrawal of the amount the HDFC Bank, Dibrugarh Branch is the drawee bank. Hence, the objection raised about the jurisdiction of this court by the accused person's side is quite immaterial and not maintainable in law. It may be pointed out that the complainant was quite silent of the fact that the accused collected money from the PW-1 at Dibrugarh. It is a business relationship occurred in [ENTITY] as J & J Firm run by the complainant is situated in [ENTITY]. From the above premises the Dibrugarh Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the above petition filed by the complainant. Thus, the point No.1 is decided against the complainant.\" 11. The observations and discussions made in Paragraphs-13 and 16 are also very much relevant for the decision of the instant appeal as those paragraphs dealt with the merit of the case. Paragraphs-13 and 16 are quoted as follows: \"13. That apart, complainant produced no material in order to prove that he had such a considerable amount of Rs.45 lakhs with him when the accused challenged his alleged payment to him. The complainant could not produce any document in support of having such a big amount at the material time. He took a plea that he paid the amount to the accused after collecting the same from different persons. Those money lenders would/should/could have been material witness for the complainant but since the alleged pleas were false one as such, the complainant could not produce any such money lenders in order to prove that he had to take money from different persons for making payment to the accused. From the cross-examination of PW-1 it has been clearly proved that the complainant never had Rs.45 lakhs with him at the material time, therefore, to pay the accused such a heavy amount is far cry. Therefore, the prima facie burden of payment to the accused could not be discharged by the complainant. ORDER"

Although in cases filed under [ACT], an affidavit in lieu of the statement under [SECTION] [ACT] is filed under [SECTION] yet the Court, before it decides to act on the affidavit and issue process, ascertain that conditions requisite for initiation of proceedings under [SECTION] of the Act have been complied with. Once the Court decides to issue process against the accused it is implied that there are sufficient grounds for proceeding against the accused and that the Court has territorial jurisdiction to try the case. The question whether a Court, having issued process against the accused, retract to the stage of consideration whether it has territorial jurisdiction or not, came up for consideration in the case of [ENTITY] vs Dwarkesh Diamonds (P) Ltd., reported in (2014) 2 SCC 246."

The learned Metropolitan Magistrate after recording of the pre-summoning evidence, issued summons on the accused under [SECTION] [ACT]. The accused persons, in both the complaints, then filed application under [SECTION] [ACT] for return of complaints for want of jurisdiction. They alleged that the entire transaction took place at New Delhi and only the legal notice was issued from Mumbai. Hence, the learned Magistrate has no jurisdiction to try and entertain the complaints. Thereafter, the learned Magistrate allowed the application under [SECTION] [ACT] and returned the complaints for want of jurisdiction.

Once the Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence forms his opinion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding and issues summons under [SECTION] [ACT], there is no question of going back following the procedure under [SECTION] [ACT].

The Cheque was deposited in the account of complainant at Dibrugarh. It is an admitted position that complainant is a resident of Dibrugarh. The bank slip regarding dishonor of the Cheque was issued to the complainant-appellant at Dibrugarh. The statutory demand notice to the accused respondent was also issued by the complainant from Dibrugarh. Thus, three acts, out of the five acts, as mentioned in the [ENTITY] (supra), admittedly, took place at Dibrugarh.

As discussed, hereinbefore, once the process was issued and case was set for trial it was open to the accused to challenge the territorial jurisdiction of the trial Court by making appropriate applications before the Superior Court. Since the accused did not challenge the jurisdiction of the trial Court it was absolutely unnecessary for the learned trial Court to go into the aspects of territorial jurisdiction and the case should have been decided on merit. This apart, as a consequence of a Court not having territorial jurisdiction, an order of acquittal cannot be recorded. An order of acquittal is recorded only when the trial Court has examined the case on the basis of evidence tendered and finds that charges have not been proved. The provisions of [SECTION] of [ACT] is clear that if the Court, at the proper stage, finds that it has no territorial jurisdiction it shall return the complaint to be filed in proper Court. Once the complaint is returned no question of entering into the merits of the case would arise because the further proceedings of the case would be taken only in the Court having jurisdiction."

On the death of the original landlord, respondent Nos. 1 to 12 have become the owner-landlords of the said lands. Respondent Nos. 1 to 6 served on the petitioner a notice dated February 19, 1959, under [SECTION] of the Act terminating his tenancy on the ground that they required the lands bonafide for a non-agricultural purpose. After thus terminating the tenancy on November 28, 1959, respondent Nos. 1 to 6 filed [CASE NUMBER] in the Court of the Tehsildar for possession of the said lands. The tenant inter alia contended that the notice of termination of the tenancy was not legal and also that the landlords did not bonafide require the lands for a non-agricultural purpose as alleged by them.

By its order dated June 29, 1974, the Tribunal rejected the Revision Application. Thus according to the orders passed in these proceedings the landlords are entitled to get possession of 5/6th share in the said lands. Aggrieved by the order of the Revenue Tribunal, the petitioner - tenant has filed this Writ Petition under [SECTION] read with [SECTION] of the [ACT].

In this case the petitioners are the landlords and the respondent is the tenant of Survey No. 33-A-1/5 A-l, admeasuring 24 1/2 gunthas situate within the Municipal limits of Vengurla in Ratnagiri District (now Sindhudurg District). The petitioners served upon the respondent a notice dated September 26, 1976, under [SECTION] of the Act terminating his tenancy by the end of May 1976 on the ground that they bonafide required the land for a non-agricultural purpose viz. the construction of a theatre. After thus terminating the tenancy, on June 21, 1976, the petitioners filed [CASE NUMBER] before the Tehsildar for possession on the aforesaid ground. The respondent's defence inter alia was that he was not a protected tenant, but was a permanent tenant and not liable to be evicted. He also denied that the petitioners bonafide required the land for the non-agricultural purpose set up by them. By order dated October 30, 1976, the Tehsildar granted the application and passed an order directing delivery of the land to the petitioners. During the pendency of this application before the Tehsildar, [CASE NUMBER] incorporating provisions seeking, to amend certain provisions of the [ACT], the [ACT], and the [ACT], was introduced in the legislature. The petitioners preferred [CASE NUMBER] challenging the decision of Tehsildar. By his order dated September 29, 1977, the Deputy Collector allowed the respondent's appeal and dismissed the petitioners' application for possession inter alia holding that the petitioners had failed to prove that they required the land bonafide for non-agricultural use. On July 26, 1978, the revision application filed by the petitioners against the order of the Deputy Collector was also dismissed. The Tribunal confirmed the finding of the Deputy Collector that the bonafides were not proved. During the pendency of the appeal before the Deputy Collector the [ACT] came into force with effect from March 11, 1977. By this [ACT] the provisions of [SECTION] of the [ACT] were deleted and retrospective operation was given to the said deletion of [SECTION] and where the conditions mentioned in [SECTION] of the [ACT] were satisfied, the pending, proceedings under [SECTION] stood abated. Apart from holding against the petitioners on merits as stated above, the Tribunal also held that in view of the provisions of [SECTION] of the [ACT] the proceedings for possession had abated since admittedly the landlord had not taken possession of the land as contemplated by [SECTION] of the [ACT]."

            "4. Before we proceed to examine the contentions urged on behalf of the landlords by their respective counsel, it would be necessary to note the scheme of the Act as it stood' prior to the coming into force of the [ACT] and its effect on its application on its coming into force. By the amending [ACT] the [ACT] which was then in force in the Bombay State was drastically amended and certain rights of ownership in the tenanted land were conferred on the tenants and the landlords were given opportunity to terminate the tenancy on certain specified grounds. Under [SECTION] it has been inter alia provided that on the first day of April 1957 referred to as \"the tillers' day\" every tenant shall, subject to the provisions of the next succeeding sections, be deemed to have purchased from his landlord, free of all encumbrances subsisting thereon on the said day, the land held by him as tenant. It is not necessary for our purpose to mention the various contingencies under which this right of the tenant gets defeated. [SECTION] provides for right to the landlord to terminate the tenancy for personal cultivation and non-agricultural use and except in the case of minors and widows and persons under disability the right has to be exercised within the prescribed period i.e. before March 31, 1957, by making an application to the Tehsildar for possession on the ground that he bonafide required the land either for cultivating the land personally or for any non-agricultural purpose. Then there are certain provisions putting further restrictions even on the establishment of his bonafides by the landlord. For example, the termination can be only to the extent of half of the land and there are provisions relating to> the disposal of the remaining half of the land. As pointed out above, the right of the tenants to become the owners of the land on the tiller's day is postponed in the case of minors, widows and person having disability. [SECTION] inter alia provides the period during which the tenant can exercise his right of purchase of such land under [SECTION] on cessation of disability or the tenant attaining majority and so on. Different periods are prescribed during which such rights can be exercised by the tenants, It also takes note of small landlords and a provision is made under [SECTION] whereby such landlords are entitled to apply for an exemption certificate provided the land does not exceed economic holding and the annual income including the rent of the land does not exceed Rs. 1,500/-. [SECTION] demies 'certificated landlord' for the purpose of [SECTION] and [SECTION] According to the definition, certificated landlord means a person who holds a certificate issued to him under [SECTION]. Special rights arc conferred on such certificated landlords to terminate the tenancy for personal cultivation and the procedure is prescribed in [SECTION] whereunder the certificated landlord is given a right to terminate the tenancy of the excluded tenant if the landlord bonafide requires such land for personal cultivation. Under [SECTION] 'excluded tenant' means a tenant of land to which [SECTION] (both inclusive) do not apply by virtue of [SECTION] The application was required to be made within the prescribed period of limitation. Then in the case of a certificated landlord who is a minor or widow or a person subject to disability the period for terminating the tenancy and making the application is extended. Thus it would be seen that the difference between [SECTION] and [SECTION] lies in that whereas under [SECTION] the landlord is entitled to terminate the tenancy both on the ground of personal cultivation and non-agricultural purpose; under [SECTION] he could do so only on the ground that he requires the land for personal cultivation.

            "7. The facts of [CASE NUMBER] which as mentioned above would show that prior to the coming into force of the [ACT] the Tehsildar had passed the order for delivery of possession in favour of the landlords. On this basis it was contended by Mr. [ENTITY], the learned Counsel, appearing on behalf of the petitioners that since the order was passed prior to the coming into operation of the [ACT] and the Act did not provide for an appeal against an order under [SECTION], the landlords had acquired a vested right which was not intended to be taken away nor could it be taken away by the provisions of [SECTION] of the [ACT]. He submitted that the appeal filed by the tenant was incompetent and the order passed therein is a nullity and the proceedings in appeal could not be treated as tenancy proceedings which is a condition precedent for the applicability of [SECTION]. In support of his contention the counsel relied on [SECTION] of the Act which enumerates the various orders made under different sections of the Act which are made appealable. It is seen that [SECTION] did not mention specifically an order under [SECTION] as one against which an appeal can be filed, We see no merit in the contention of the learned Counsel that merely because [SECTION] is not mentioned in [SECTION] the order passed in the proceedings for possession on the grounds mentioned in [SECTION] are not appealable. Analysing [SECTION] it is seen that Sub-section (1) thereof provides the ground and the procedure for termination of tenancy. Sub-section 2 states that the provisions of [SECTION], [SECTION] and [SECTION] shall mutatis mutandis apply to the termination of the tenancy of a tenant in respect of any land under Sub-section 1. In other words, in so far as they are applicable the provisions of [SECTION], [SECTION] and [SECTION] would be applicable in respect of the cause of action accrued to the landlord under Sub-section 1. While [SECTION] read with [SECTION] provides a procedure for making an application, it does not provide for the passing of an order under that section. It is by reason of [SECTION] that we have to turn to [SECTION] which provides a procedure for making an application and also conferring jurisdiction on the authority to pass an order on such application. This is clear from [SECTION] which inter alia provides that no landlord shall obtain possession of any land or dwelling, house held by a tenant except under an order of Mamlatdar and for obtaining such order he shall make an application in the prescribed form and within a period of two years from the date on which the right to obtain possession of the land or dwelling house, as the case may be, is deemed to have accrued to him. The enquiry on\" the application and the orders to be passed therein are contemplated by [SECTION]. [SECTION] inter alia provides that on receipt of application under Sub-section (1) or (2) the Mamlatdar shall after holding an inquiry, pass such order thereon as he deems fit. It may be mentioned that [SECTION] also contemplates an application for possession to the Collector, but that relates to termination of tenancy under [SECTION] It is, therefore, clear that [SECTION] does not by itself contemplate a proceeding before the Tehsildar, but it contemplates the passing of an order under that section by the Tehsildar. By reason of [SECTION], the provisions of [SECTION] have been extended to [SECTION] and, therefore, the landlord is entitled to terminate the tenancy under [SECTION] and resort to the procedure and remedy prescribed under [SECTION]. It is under [SECTION] under which the final order in a proceeding is passed. The question, therefore, would be whether an order under [SECTION] is made appealable. [SECTION] clearly provides for an appeal against an order under [SECTION] in Sub-section (m) of Sub-section (1). It was, however, urged by Mr. [ENTITY] that [SECTION] is the only provision in the Act which enumerates the various orders which are made appealable and whereas orders under [SECTION] and [SECTION] which are also provisions relating to the right of the landlord to obtain possession of the land are mentioned in [SECTION] as appealable orders, [SECTION] does not refer to [SECTION] as one of the sections orders whereunder are appealable. He also submitted that in all these cases viz. applications under [SECTION], [SECTION] and [SECTION] the order has to be passed under [SECTION] and, therefore, the reference to orders under [SECTION] in [SECTION] would not be of assistance in determining the question as to whether an order under [SECTION] is appealable. In our view, it is not possible to accept this contention of the learned Counsel having regard to the fact that in a proceeding started under [SECTION] it is not under that section, but it is under [SECTION] that the order is passed by the Tehsildar. It is true that since even in respect of [SECTION] and [SECTION] the provisions show that the order is ultimately passed under [SECTION] and, therefore, it can be said that it was unnecessary for the legislature to specifically mention [SECTION] and [SECTION] in [SECTION]. But that by itself does not necessarily lead to the inference that the Legislature's intention was to exclude [SECTION] from appealable orders. Though analogies or comparisons are some times useful to interpret a statutory provision, the resort to the same would be permissible only if the intention of the legislature cannot be gathered from the plain words used. It is well settled that the intention of the legislature has to be primarily gathered from the plain language used. [SECTION] clearly provides for an appeal against an order passed under [SECTION]. On a plain reading of [SECTION] it is crystal clear that the application for possession is contemplated thereunder to be filed under [SECTION] as also the final order is passed under [SECTION]. [SECTION] provides that the provision of [SECTION] shall 'mutatis mutandis' apply to the termination of the tenancy of a tenant in respect of any land under [SECTION] [SECTION] merely provides for the giving of notice to the tenant terminating the tenancy of the tenant on the ground that the landlord bonafide requires the land for any non-agricultural purposes. This would show that as far as the making of the application for possession and the further proceeding pursuant thereto as also the final order for possession has to be under [SECTION]. In view of this clear position it would be impermissible to hold that no appeal lies on the ground that [SECTION] is not referred to in [SECTION]. If the intention of the legislature was to provide an independent procedure like the one provided in [SECTION] as a part and parcel of [SECTION] it would have been easy for the legislature to do so by making a clear provision in that behalf in [SECTION] itself. In our view, the provisions of [SECTION] make it abundantly clear that the order has to be passed under [SECTION] and there is no dispute that an order under [SECTION] is appealable. As far as the express mention of [SECTION] and [SECTION] in [SECTION] all that can be said is the legislature may have done so out of abundant precaution. In our view, therefore, the appeal preferred by the tenant was competent."

            "8. Having held that the appeal is competent, we have to consider the effect of [SECTION] of the [ACT] which came into force during the pendency of the appeal. The examination of this rather clumsily worded provision shows that it envisages that notwithstanding the deletion of [SECTION] certain proceedings shall be continued as if the amendment Act was not passed while some other proceedings were to abate. The first catagory viz. the catagory of cases which were to be continued and disposed of by the authority as if the Act had not been passed are proceedings which were pending and the landlord had taken possession of the land on or before the date of the introduction of [ACT] and the [ACT], i.e. [CASE NUMBER] which ultimately was passed as Act X of 1977. The introduction of the Bill is dated July 5, 1976. Obviously, [SECTION] applies to pending proceedings though some of these proceedings may be in the nature of revision applications or appeals in which orders have been already passed. The crucial question that has to be seen is whether the landlord had obtained or not the possession before the date of the introduction of the Bill viz. July 5, 1976. If the landlord had taken possession of the land before that date, the order passed by the Tehsildar which may be the subject matter of the appeal or a revision, such pending proceeding is to be continued as if the [SECTION] was not deleted. The intention appears to be to give the tenant an opportunity to prove his case. As far as the cases where possession has not been taken by the landlords are concerned, the section provides that all such pending proceedings shall abate notwithstanding the fact that an order for delivery of possession had already been passed and the same is challenged in the pending proceedings. The case of the landlords in [CASE NUMBER] clearly falls in this catagory in view of the admitted fact that the landlord had not taken possession of the land and the tenant all along continued to be in possession."

Alternatively, he submitted that the provision is discriminatory and violative of [SECTION] of the [ACT]. The counsel submitted that the right to obtain possession from the tenant is a right to property and a law' taking away that right must satisfy the requirements under [SECTION]. It must be shown that the restrictions affecting the landlord's right to property were reasonable and in public interest. It may be observed at the outset that the [ACT] as amended by the [ACT] has been held to be valid. (See [PRECEDENT] . The counsel did not dispute that the Act as it stood prior to the deletion of [SECTION] 'was constitutionally valid. The amendment viz. the deletion of [SECTION] takes away the right of the landlords to claim the land from the tenant on the grounds mentioned in the repealed section and to that extent it has to satisfy the test of reasonableness as contemplated by [SECTION]. As far as [SECTION] is concerned, it is contended that the landlord wanted the land for the construction of a theatre and carry on his business and as such his fundamental right under [SECTION] is also affected and, therefore, the restrictions put on his right by the deletion of [SECTION] must be shown to be reasonable and in the public interest. It is further urged that since [SECTION] of the Amendment Act takes away the landlord's tight crystallized by the notice of termination, and also by order of the competent authority taking away of such right vested in the landlords would amount to infringement of [SECTION]. As far as violation of [SECTION] is concerned, the contention raised is that an arbitrary discrimination is made between the landlords who had taken possession and those who had not done so. Secondly, the landlords in Municipal areas are discriminated against as they are denied to resume lands for non-agricultural purpose, whereas the landlords in non-municipal areas can avail of [SECTION] to enforce such a right. According to the learned Counsel, there is no rational basis for making a distinction between the two classes of landlords nor has such a classification any nexus with the object of the statute. Whereas atleast a limited right to resume for bonafide personal use h given under the Act in respect of lands situate outside municipal limits such a right is denied only to a particular class of landlords viz. those whose lands fall within the municipal limits."

In the absence of such a return filed by the State there is nothing to show that there were conditions which existed justifying the legislation as being reasonable and in the public interest.

Under the provisions of that Act the tenants were given right to purchase land upto one family holding subject to landlord's ownership right remaining intact in, respect of land upto two family holdings had also been implemented. The disparity thus was that in case of surviving tenancies in municipal areas in the Marathwada, the tenants enjoy security of tenure and fixity of rent and the landlords do not have any subsisting right to resume land for bona Me personal cultivation or for non-agricultural use. One of the objects of the amendment is to remove the disparity in the law prevailing in the three areas. The second important aspect mentioned is the provisions of [SECTION] of the [ACT], which is uniformly applicable throughout the State, under which the landlord cannot convert the land for non-agricultural use without the consent of the tenant or as the case may be, of the landlord. These two considerations, in our view, which were taken into account by the legislature in passing the impugned enactment would satisfy the requirements of reasonableness and public interest contained in [SECTION] of the [ACT]. Having regard to the provisions of [SECTION] of the [ACT], which are uniformly applicable, a landlord would be met with a plea by the tenant that no order for eviction should be passed since the landlord while terminating the tenancy was not entitled to convert the land to his own use without the consent of the tenant. That apart, it may also be borne in mind that [SECTION] of the [ACT] contains special provisions in respect to the areas within the limits of Municipality. [SECTION] as it existed prior to the amendment by the [ACT] shows that a distinction was made between the urban land and rural land. It is not disputed before us that the classification so made is reasonable having regard to conditions prevailing in urban and rural areas. Whereas, in non-municipal areas the tenant under [SECTION] of the Act was made the owner, that provision was not applicable to municipal areas. Thus, the landlords in municipal areas were placed in a somewhat advantageous position because none of the provisions relating to the passing of the title in the land to the tenant applied. Not only this, but the provisions giving a right to the landlord to terminate the tenancy and make an application to the Tehsildar for bonafide personal cultivation and for putting the land to non-agricultural use contained in [SECTION] and [SECTION] were also available to a municipal landlord. Thus, so far as that is concerned, there was uniformity in respect of the landlord's rights to terminate the tenancy subject of course to the conditions laid down in various provisions of the Act. Deletion of [SECTION] obviously cannot disturb such rights under [SECTION] and [SECTION] of the Municipal landlords though it may be mentioned that except with regard to a few cases involving minors, disabled persons or widows the rights as on April 1, 1957 have been already worked out. As a matter of fact, the insertion of [SECTION] would otherwise have made the municipal landlords to lose their right to continue to enjoy their ownership rights while their right to terminate the tenancy under [SECTION] of the Act are not disturbed. As pointed out above, the necessity of bringing about a uniformity in all the three regions and avoidance of a clash with the provisions of [SECTION] of the [ACT], by reason of continuing (he provisions of the [SECTION] are to our mind sufficient to show that the restrictions on the landlord's right to terminate the tenancy under [SECTION] imposed by the deletion cannot be said to be unreasonable or not in public interest, If this is so, the challenge to the deletion of [SECTION] on the ground of violation of [SECTION] must fail."

As far as the lands outside the municipal areas are concerned, the provisions just did not exist. In a sense, by bringing about a uniformity, the discrimination, if any, between the rural landlord and the municipal landlord has been removed."

            "16. Then the next question is whether any discrimination inter-se between the municipal landlords arises on account of the provisions of [SECTION] of the [ACT]. As pointed out above, in the case of pending proceedings where the landlord has taken possession of the land, such proceedings are to continue as if [SECTION] is not deleted. However, as regards the pending proceedings where the landlord has not taken possession of the land, notwithstanding the orders passed in favour of the landlords such proceedings abate. What has been done is that the tenant is given, an opportunity to get back the possession of the land which he has lost in execution of the order for possession passed prior to the amendment and has filed further proceedings challenging the said order. The order under which such possession is taken is obviously not a final order and it would appear that the distinction made removes the discrimination between the landlords viz. those who had taken possession and those who have not. It was urged by Mr. [ENTITY] that in the case of non-municipal areas where the tenant has become the statutory owner, the landlord gets compensation; whereas in the case of municipal areas on account of the non-applicability of [SECTION] of the Act the landlord continues to be the landlord of the land and he is deprived of his compensation which he would otherwise have got if the tenant had become the owner. He submitted that the continuance of the ownership of the landlord with the right to terminate the tenancy under [SECTION] is illusory because it is not likely that any tenant would foolishly commit default in payment of rent which is a very paltry amount determined under the Act. It is submitted that the land being in municipal area, in the case of acquisition under the [ACT] the tenant would be entitled to a large chunk of compensation in view of his Tights under the [ACT]. We are not impressed by this submission because these arguments are advanced possibly taking into view the present conditions prevailing in the municipal areas on account of the recent developments in those areas It may well be said that if the tenant was to be made the owner on April 1, 1957 in the case of these lands, by applying the provisions of [SECTION] the landlord could have secured a meagre amount as would be determined under the Act, In our view, such considerations put forth by Mr. [ENTITY] would not be relevant while determining the question of discrimination. Indeed, it has not been disputed that the classification between the lands in municipal areas and those in non-municipal areas is reasonable and consistent with the object of the tenancy law. We are, therefore, unable to accept the argument that the deletion of [SECTION] offends [SECTION] of the [ACT]."

He also further contended that [SECTION] and [SECTION], [ACT] has to be read in the context of [SECTION] of the [ACT] (in short the [ACT]) and the Court has to presume that the death of the deceased-[ENTITY] to be a dowry death and it was open to the Court to presume further that the appellant being the husband of the deceased-wife was responsible for such death since he was present in the room where 80% burn injury was caused to the deceased-wife due to setting fire on her person. In support of his said contention he relied upon the decision of the Apex Court in the case of [PRECEDENT]. He also contended that in view of [SECTION] of the [ACT], it is the duty of the inmates of the matrimonial house of the deceased including the husband-accused to give a cogent explanation as to how the crime was committed and inmates of the house cannot get away by simply getting acquitted and offering no explanation. He also contended that in a case of [SECTION] and [SECTION], [ACT], the burden of the prosecution is comparatively lighter than the other offences and in the instant case the inmates of the matrimonial home of deceased including her husband did not give any explanation how the crime was committed and hence the Court has no other option except to presume that the deceased was set on fire by the husband accused-respondent, which the trial Court fails. In support of the aforesaid contention he also relied and referred to a decision of the Apex Court in the case of [PRECEDENT]. With the aforesaid submission, Mr. [ENTITY], learned Addl.

He also contended that the learned trial Court rightly did not frame any charge under [SECTION], [ACT] against the accused-respondent, as there was no evidence available for doing so. He further submitted that it is evident from the evidence of the prosecution witnesses that the husband, accused-respondent and the wife, deceased were leading a peaceful life after their marriage and their relation was cordial but the cause of death of the deceased-wife is an accident of fire. In support of his aforesaid contention he mainly relied on the statements of P.W. Nos. 2, 3 and 12. He again contended that had the deceased been set on fire on her person by the accused-respondent then she would have disclosed the name of the accused-respondent either to her inmates including P.W. Nos. 1, 5, 6 and 9 or to the Doctor during the period of her treatment but she did not do so, from which it can be easily presumed that the accused-respondent is in no way involved with the said accident of fire.

            "Precedent",
            "18. The concept of \"dowry\" is intermittently linked with a marriage and the provisions of the [ENTITY] Act apply in relation to marriages. If the legality of the marriage itself is an issue further legalistic problems do arise. If the validity of the marriage itself is under legal scrutiny, the demand of dowry in respect of an invalid marriage would be legally not recognizable. Even then the purpose for which [SECTION] and [SECTION], [ACT] and [SECTION] of the [ACT] (for short the '[ACT]') were introduced cannot be lost sight of. Legislations enacted with some policy to curb and alleviate some public evil rampant in society and effectuate a definite public purpose or benefit positively requires to be interpreted with certain element of realism too and not merely pedantically or hyper technically. The obvious objective was to prevent harassment to a woman who enters into a marital relationship with a person and later on, becomes a victim of the greed for money. Can a person who enters into a marital arrangement be allowed to take a shelter behind a smoke screen to contend that since there was no valid marriage the question of dowry does not arise? Such hairsplitting legalistic approach would encourage harassment to a woman over demand of money. The nomenclature 'dowry' does not have any magic charm written over it. It is that a label given to demand of money in relation to marital relationship. The legislative intent is clear from the fact that it is not only the husband but also his relations who are covered by [SECTION] Legislature has taken care of children born from invalid marriages. [SECTION] of the [ACT] deals with legitimacy of children of void and voidable marriages. Can it be said that Legislature which was conscious of the social stigma attached to children of void and voidable marriages closed eyes to plight of a woman who unknowingly or unconscious of the legal consequences entered into the marital relationship. If such restricted meaning is given, it would not further the legislative intent. On the contrary, it would be against the concerned shown by the Legislature for avoiding harassment to a woman over demand of money in relation to marriages. The first exception to [SECTION] has also some relevance. According to it, the offence of bigamy will not apply to \"any person whose marriage with such husband or wife has been declared void by a Court of competent jurisdiction.\" It would be appropriate to construe the expression 'husband' to cover a person who enters into marital relationship and under the colour of such proclaimed or feigned status of husband subjects the woman concerned to cruelty or coerce her in any manner or for any of the purposes enumerated in the relevant provisions [SECTION]-A, whatever be the legitimacy of the marriage itself for the limited purpose of [SECTION] and [SECTION], [ACT] Such an interpretation, known and recognised as purposive construction has come into play in a case of this nature. The absence of a definition of 'husband' to specifically include such per-sons who contract marriages ostensibly and cohabitate with such woman, in the purported exercise of his role and status as 'husband' is no ground to exclude them from the purview of [SECTION] or [SECTION], [ACT] viewed in the context of the very object and aim of the legislations introducing those provisions."

According to the Court that would not be proper, unless the prosecution establish the connection of the accused respondent with the alleged offence, nature of offence whatever may be high or heinous that itself would not connect an accused with such an offence, it is the evidence of the witnesses which would connect the accused with such an offence.

While dealing with a case of acquittal, it is well known, the High Court shall not ordinarily overturn a judgment if two views are possible."

We do not, however, mean to lay down the law that the High Court, in a case where a judgment of acquittal is in question, would not go into the evidence brought on records by the prosecution or by the State but we would like to point out that even if the High Court reversed the judgment of acquittal recorded by the Trial Court, it is incumbent on the High Court to arrive at the conclusion that no two views are possible."

From the evidence available, two views are possible in the instant case, one is, the accused may commit the offence for which the charge has been levelled against him and another is, the accused may not commit the offence for which the charge has been levelled against him and he is totally innocent and victim of situation. Therefore, after going through the findings of the learned Addl.

The place of recovery was busy place and as such it is not possible to conduct the proceedings at that place. So, the explanation given by the prosecution in this regard, appeals to the reason. The reason for non-joining of independent witness has been given [ENTITY] 2013.10.10 12:52 I attest to the accuracy and integrity of this document Punjab and Haryana High Court Chandigarh as nobody was ready to join the investigation. Normally, general public is reluctant to join the police proceedings as they do not want to appear in the Court. No specific question regarding keys was asked to the prosecution witnesses. Without keys the motor cycle could not be taken from the stated place. Mere fact that FSL form is not filled at the spot is not a ground to discard the prosecution story. The official of FSL have categorically stated that sample was intact and the same was not tampered with. Mere fact that no entry was made in the police station is not a ground to discard the prosecution story. The recovery has not been effected in the police station and as such there was no necessity to make any entry. The sample was drawn at the police station. Mere fact that form No.[SECTION] was not filled at the spot is also not a ground to discard the prosecution version. It is not the mandatory requirement of law that money should have been recovered from the accused."
